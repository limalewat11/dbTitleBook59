They played together all the time. They liked the same games, and they liked each other.</p><p>But one day everything changed.</p><p>Can best friends remain best friends no matter what happens? For Farfallina and Marcel, who endure growing up and growing apart only to find that it brings them closer together, the happy answer is "yes."</p></p><p><p> Holly Keller is the creator of many popular books for children, including the Horace books, <i>Farfallina &amp; Marcel</i>, and <i>Help!</i> In applauding her work, <i>School Library Journal</i> noted that she is "an author/artist who truly understands children." Holly Keller lives in New Haven, Connecticut. </p>Keller (Cecil's Garden) introduces a caterpillar and gosling in a deceptively simple story of friendship and transformation. They meet in a rain shower one day: " `Hey,' said a little voice./ `You're eating my umbrella," says feathered Marcel as Farfallina (whose name means "little butterfly" in Italian) nibbles on a leaf over his head. With a minimum of text, Keller describes the charming friendship's beginnings. When they play hide-and-seek, Farfallina hides under a low fern "because she knew that Marcel couldn't climb." In turn, Marcel hides behind a nearby tree "because he knew that Farfallina moved slowly." A full-page full-bleed painting shows Farfallina riding on the gosling's back across a lily-pad-dotted pond. One day, the caterpillar announces that she needs to climb onto a tree branch and rest for a while, and her patient pal settles in the grass to wait for her. A series of paintings follows each friend's metamorphosis Marcel's change in plumage, Farfallina's emergence from her cocoon. Finally reunited, neither creature recognizes the other and again bond as friends nonetheless. When they realize each other's true identities, Keller conveys their joy with the pair's fluttering of wings, and their quiet repose in an eloquently serene spread as they fall asleep "smiling at the stars." Keller's ending remains true to both nature and friendship that lasts through the seasons in this perfectly paced book. Ages 4-up.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cain at Gettysburg: A Novel (The Battle Hymn Cycle, 1)</h2><p><p>Winner of the American Library Association's W. Y. Boyd Award for Excellence in Military Fiction</p><p>Two mighty armies blunder toward each other, one led by confident, beloved Robert E. Lee and the other by dour George Meade. They'll meet in a Pennsylvania crossroads town where no one planned to fight.</p><p>In this sweeping, savagely realistic novel, the greatest battle ever fought on American soil explodes into life at Gettysburg. As generals squabble, staffs err. Tragedy unfolds for immigrants in blue and barefoot Rebels alike. The fate of our nation will be decided in a few square miles of fields.</p><p>Following a tough Confederate sergeant from the Blue Ridge, a bitter Irish survivor of the Great Famine, a German political refugee, and gun crews in blue and gray, <i>Cain at Gettysburg</i> is as grand in scale as its depictions of Civil War combat are unflinching.</p><p>For three days, battle rages.

From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and former U.S. Army officer Ralph Peters, <i>Cain at Gettysburg</i> is bound to become a classic of men at war.</p><p><b>This edition of the book is the deluxe, tall rack mass market paperback.</b></p></p><p><p>RALPH PETERS, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>The War After Armageddon</i>, is a retired U.S. Army officer; a controversial strategist and veteran of the intelligence world; a journalist who appears frequently in the broadcast media; and a lifelong traveler with experience in over seventy countries on six continents. Peters has studied the Battle of Gettysburg since childhood, when his parents took him on annual pilgrimages to that hallowed ground. Combining years of walking those fields and painstaking research with insight into the souls of generals and privates gleaned from his own military career, Ralph Peters tells this great American tale in a masterful style.</p>ONE<br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>June 28, 1863</i><br><br>Annoyed by flies, Meade fell asleep at last, only to wake with a hand upon his shoulder. The intruder&#x2019;s lantern cast fantastic shadows. Hardie wore civilian clothes and crouched under the tent&#x2019;s slant. It took Meade a moment to recognize him.<br>&#x201c;What the devil?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to give you trouble,&#x201d; the colonel said.<br>Blades of alarm pierced weariness. Meade sat up sharply.<br>&#x201c;My conscience is clear,&#x201d; he declared.<br>Margaret had warned him to check his temper. Now Hooker had charged him with insubordination, with Halleck&#x2019;s acquiescence and bespectacled Hardie as henchman. He was being relieved of his command, arrested in the middle of a campaign. There would be a court-martial. Reputation&#x2019;s assassin sneaking into camp, this colonel from the adjutant general&#x2019;s office had come in the dark, in disguise. And he had always thought Hardie a decent fellow.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done&nbsp;... nothing dishonorable,&#x201d; Meade protested. &#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d; He yearned for coffee just off the fire, for the light of day, for a friend. &#x201c;My differences with General Hooker&nbsp;... have been matters of professional judgment, nothing more.&#x201d;<br>The colonel raised a hand to quiet him. The gesture struck Meade as insolent. Hardie grinned.<br>Black and devilish, flies looped around the lantern the colonel held. Settling the light on the camp desk, Hardie drew a pair of envelopes from a pocket.<br>&#x201c;General Meade, you are ordered to assume command of the Army of the Potomac. Effective immediately, sir. I&#x2019;m to accompany you to General Hooker&#x2019;s headquarters, to witness the transfer of authority.&#x201d;<br>Dumbfounded, Meade took the documents. He didn&#x2019;t open them, but held the papers atop one knee. He wondered if arrest would not have been preferable. He began to wake fully and bitterly.<br>Outside, the camp clattered, despite the wretched hour. A sergeant barked and soldiers answered. Chains chimed and horses whinnied. Hardie&#x2019;s arrival had yanked them all from sleep. His staff officers would be gathering by his tent, waiting to hear the news that had come from Washington.<br>How much had they guessed? Meade needed coffee. Coffee and John Reynolds. Reynolds was the man for this. Men followed him and loved him. Handsome John. He was the man to take command of the army. How foolish he himself had been to resent Reynolds&#x2019; advancement. He rued his pettiness now.<br>Meade sighed. He meant to rise and put on his uniform coat, to wrap his old bones in a guise of authority. But the flesh hesitated.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not qualified,&#x201d; he told Hardie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the devil&#x2019;s choice for this. I mustn&#x2019;t command this army.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the president&#x2019;s decision.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What about Reynolds? Is it true he turned it down?&#x201d;<br>Hardie shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe there was a formal offer. Anyway, the president chose you, sir. General Halleck and Mr. Stanton concurred. They sent me to Frederick by special train. There&#x2019;s no time to lose.&#x201d;<br>Meade snapped, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think I understand that?&#x201d;<br><i>Halleck.</i> The man was devoured by jealousy. Of Reynolds, that much was evident. Of Reynolds and so many others. Apparently, though, he wasn&#x2019;t jealous of everyone. What does that say of me? Meade asked himself.<br>He did his best to button up his temper. His wife had warned him, more than once, that his tongue cut worse than his sword.<br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t the seniority on the Army rolls,&#x201d; Meade insisted. Then he added, &#x201c;I thought things had been patched up with General Hooker?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. Lincoln lost faith in him.&#x201d;<br>So has the rest of this blasted army, Meade thought. Yet, removing Hooker now was madness. With battle looming. On a field yet unknown.<br>&#x201c;Hardie, I don&#x2019;t want this,&#x201d; he said in a tamed voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the man for this.&#x201d;<br>His visitor gestured toward the envelopes, which remained unopened. Meade unfolded the fateful order, bending to make out the words. Hardie took up the lantern again and brought it closer.<br>It was true. He had been selected as the latest general half-expected to fail and be damned forever.<br><i>Expected</i> to fail? Was that the nub of it?<br>Meade tested each word of the order, then studied the accompanying correspondence from the general-in-chief. &#x201c;Considering the circumstances,&#x201d; Meade read, &#x201c;no one has ever received a more important command.&#x201d;<br>A sharp-fanged creature slithered through his bowels.<br>Had it come to this? With the Confederates already marching on Philadelphia, for all he knew? For all anyone knew? The evening before, he had worn himself out riding through the Maryland countryside trying to find Hooker, the man who held the string and hid both ends. The raw, hot roads had been burdened with batteries and commissary wagons, with regiments coming late to their camps and with stragglers, some of them drunk. No one knew where the army&#x2019;s commander could be found.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want this,&#x201d; Meade said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s impossible. I shall send a message to Halleck.&#x201d;<br>Fixing his spectacles higher on his nose, Hardie said, &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t do any good, sir. The president&#x2019;s mind is made up.&#x201d; He set the lantern back down on the desk.<br>Meade arched his back. The camp bed creaked. &#x201c;Does General Hooker know?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He sent in a letter of resignation.&#x201d; A quarter-smile cut into Hardie&#x2019;s cheek. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure he meant it to be accepted. But it was.&#x201d; The smile turned cruel enough to tell Meade that Hooker had earned Hardie&#x2019;s enmity. &#x201c;I suspect he&#x2019;ll know by the time we reach army headquarters.&#x201d;<br>Meade snorted. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know where that is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll guide you there, if you&#x2019;ll loan me a horse. I came in a rented buggy.&#x201d;<br>Irritated anew that he had failed to find Hooker&#x2019;s camp the evening before, Meade asked, &#x201c;Since you&#x2019;re so well-informed, Hardie, would you happen to know where General Lee and his army are strolling just now? No one else seems to have any blasted idea. Certainly not this army&#x2019;s corps commanders.&#x201d;<br>The colonel shook his head. &#x201c;General Hooker&#x2019;s communications with Washington have been&nbsp;... limited.&#x201d; Posture deformed by the slope of the canvas, he shed another layer of formality. &#x201c;To tell you the truth, sir, he hasn&#x2019;t told us much of anything. He wouldn&#x2019;t even share his plan of campaign with Mr. Lincoln. All we heard from old Fighting Joe were calls for reinforcements and wails that the army&#x2019;s outnumbered. He sounded more and more like Little Mac. It set the president out of temper. And that&#x2019;s putting it soft.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hardie, do you know where the corps of <i>this</i> army are right now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not all of them. It took some work to find you.&#x201d;<br>The situation reminded Meade of a game he had seen blindfolded children play in Tampico. Spun round, they lashed out with a stick, trying to shatter a dangling plaster animal filled with treats. Except that there would be no treats this time. Only the blind lashing out.<br>Meade reached for his watch. Instead of metal, his hand met the sweat-heavy cloth of an undergarment. <i>Wake up,</i> he commanded himself. <i>Take hold of yourself.</i> &#x201c;What time is it, Hardie?&#x201d;<br>The colonel drew out his watch and clicked open the cover. &#x201c;Half past three, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;ll have a ride before us. If we must go through with this.&#x201d; He cleared his throat, tasting bile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a few moments alone. And you&#x2019;ll want your breakfast.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; The colonel turned to go.<br>&#x201c;Hardie?&#x201d;<br>Hand on the tent&#x2019;s flap, the visitor turned again. Reflections of the lantern&#x2019;s flame flickered on his spectacles.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been tried and condemned without a hearing, and I suppose I shall have to go to execution,&#x201d; Meade said. He attempted a smile and failed. &#x201c;Send Captain Meade to me. And tell my staff I&#x2019;ll join them shortly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Shall I let them know, sir? About the order?&#x201d;<br>Meade brushed a fly from his beard. &#x201c;Do as you see fit.&#x201d;<br>Left alone, Meade clutched the paper that damned him. His bowels winced again. The flesh always reminded a man of the constraints on human dignity.<br>In those last private moments, he thought about young George. It had wounded Meade when the boy was cast from West Point for his follies. Now he himself had been pointed toward failure, toward a far greater failure, a failure that would resound for generations. Was it a curse on the family? His father, too, had failed, in a different way, in a different world.<br>Still waking to the charge that had been given him, Meade felt a wave of shame, as if one of those Barnegat rip currents had changed the direction of an inner sea. He needed to control himself, if he hoped to control the army. To put up a manly show. How could he have indulged in such fretting in front of Hardie? How could he have shown such weakness? Weariness was no excuse, nor was confusion.<br>He imagined the colonel telling tales at the bar in Willard&#x2019;s Hotel. He could hear the laughter of clerks and politicians.<br>Well, the thing was done.<br>In the sour air of his tent, Meade viewed himself with an engineer&#x2019;s cold eye: too dark of thought, too dour, a man alert to the smell of sulfur, but not to Heaven&#x2019;s scent. He could hear Margaret teasing, &#x201c;George, I know you can smile!&#x201d; His wife was a proud, loyal woman, of good family. She had got him a brigadier&#x2019;s rank at the start of the war, when his merits had not sufficed. He would have to do his best for her. And for the Union, of course.<br>Major General George Gordon Meade ha...</p><h2>The Flight from Truth: The Reign of Deceit in the Age of Information</h2><p>A distinguished French philosopher argues that the greatest threat to modern democracy is the dissemination of false information, myths that endanger the viability of freedom and the democratic way of life</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchThough Revel's stated aim here is to examine why human beings ``neglect the genuine knowledge that is available to them and...base their conceptions and actions on false information,'' he ends up delivering mostly a tirade against the Left that becomes a vehicle for defending his earlier writings (How Democracies Perish, 1984, etc.). Revel's claim that he could as well take to task ``scholastic Aristotelian ideology'' as the ``more familiar'' Marxism sets his tone. Certainly the notion that ``we use our intellectual faculties to protect conviction, interests and interpretations...dear to us'' has merit. But Revel never explores this idea beyond applying it to the supposed acceptance of communism by Western thinkers and liberals who ``have always adhered to the official Soviet `truth' of the moment.'' He warns against the ``a priori trust in perestroika and glasnost'' demonstrated by duped Western democracies soft on communism; rails against the ``pigheaded Left''; and scolds the media for failing to credit the ``classic dictatorships'' of Franco, Pinochet, and Marcos for being better organized than their Marxist counterparts. Among his more unsettling, unsubstantiated claims: that, despite their nostalgia for Third Reich symbolism, recent ``hallucinatory resurrections of the Nazi danger,'' as embodied by neo-Nazi groups, are ``a political fable'' invented by the Left to distract attention from the horrors of communism; that ``humanitarian aid'' is a ruse, ``a gigantic racket'' engineered by calculating Marxist despots; that ``the falsification of information is today...above all a left-wing phenomenon''; and that the supposed racism of France's National Front and the apartheid state of South Africa are not akin to fascism but are mere xenophobia, being ``prompted by thoughtless prejudice, not by a clearly argued ideology.'' A conservative storm cloud of right-wing rumblings and intellectual lightning. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This is not me. It's so stupid when you think about it. It shouldn't have caused a death. I don't blame me. We just need a little growing up. We were young, and we still are." Aphrodite Jones takes the reader into the world of several teenage girls in small-town southern Indiana--their clothes, rock music, and fascination with offbeat spirituality, and also their lesbian jealousies and penchant for violence. This book provides a useful balance to an earlier account by Michael Quinlan (<i>Little Lost Angel</i>). Jones's style is less dramatic than Quinlan's, but she devotes more space to the family backgrounds and psychological complexities of the two girls whose hot-vs-cold temperaments meshed to bring about the murder of 12-year-old Shanda Sharer.Aphrodite Jones is an award-winning American reporter and author who writes about unusual and puzzling murder cases. Her knack for detail allows her to dissect bizarre homicide stories and bring readers into the hearts and minds of victims and their killers. Now, the author has taken her career to TV as the executive producer and TV host of the ID series, "True Crime with Aphrodite Jones," which airs on Investigation Discovery. In it, Jones uncovers secrets about some of the most high profile cases in America, from Jon Benet Ramsey to O.J. Simpson, from Anna Nicole Smith to Casey Anthony, the author re-investigates and reveals details never known before. These days, Aphrodite Jones, who&#x2019;s written a string of best-selling true crime books, is also commenting on the crime mysteries lurking behind news headlines as she joins Dr. Oz for "True Crime Tuesdays."</p><h2>Corrie Ten Boom: Her Story : A Collection Consisting of the Hiding Place, Tramp for the Lord, and Jesus Is Victor</h2><p>Three bestselling autobiographies, <em>The Hiding Place, Tramp for the Lord, </em>and <em>Jesus is Victor, </em>by Corrie Ten Boom.&nbsp; These spell-binding stories have sold over 2,000,000 copies.&nbsp; Now all together in one volume.</p><p></p><h2>Let&#39;s Panic About Babies!: How to Endure and Possibly Triumph Over the Adorable Tyrant Who Will Ruin Your Body, Destroy Your Life, Liquefy Your Brain, ...

IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE PREGNANT</b><b>G</b>reetings, woman. You are gloriously full with child, living proof of the miracle of creation, or else you wouldn&#x2019;t be reading this. Unless you&#x2019;re just curious. Or you&#x2019;re a man, and you have some sort of fetish. Well, as long as you paid for the book and are not soiling it in a dim corner of your local bookstore, we&#x2019;re okay with that.But let us return to you, the reader who is actually, validly pregnant, and not at all some moist-palmed pervert. Our first question is: Are you <i>sure</i> you&#x2019;re pregnant?It&#x2019;s a little-known fact that 83 percent of people who believe they&#x2019;re pregnant are not; of those people, 47 percent stuffed an embroidered keepsake pillow under their shirt to see how it would look. The remaining 59 percent are merely confused about how <i>The Secret</i> works. And for good reason! A strong desire to manifest the symptoms of pregnancy can result in all sorts of misleading indicators. Vomiting, fatigue, bloating, cessation of one&#x2019;s period: sounds like a normal day at our house! So how is a woman to know?<br><b>What You Might Be Instead of Pregnant</b><br><br><b>Not-pregnant</b><br><br><b>Hysterical</b><br><br><b>Recovering from a plate of bad clams</b><br><br><b>A snake that recently swallowed a full-grown ewe</b><br><br><b>Pumpkin costume!</b><br><br><b>Unable to button your pants</b><br><br><b>Nurturing an eight-pound subcutaneous grapefruit</b><br><br><b>A man</b><br>Only with professional confirmation! But maybe not even then! So-called &#x201c;blood tests&#x201d; and &#x201c;urine-sampling kits&#x201d; are (probably) no more than a thinly veiled excuse for necromancy. No one knows what doctors actually do with your blood and/or urine or whatever other fluid they demand from you that day. We suspect they shut the door, bury your sample beneath the floorboards, and leap into a mountain of that day&#x2019;s copayment fees.And yet their &#x201c;tests&#x201d; are the only ones that hold up under legal scrutiny, so we must grit our teeth and soldier on.Here are some ways you may have validly discovered that you were actually pregnant and not imagining things: � Multiple positive at-home pregnancy tests� Positive blood test using blood taken from <i>your very own arm</i>� Doctor shakes you and demands that you maintain eye contact while he tells you you&#x2019;re pregnant� Everyone&#x2019;s congratulating you, and not in a sarcastic way� You&#x2019;re standing in a bookstore, reading this book <i>(What are you waiting for?

Don&#x2019;t look away from us, or ask what &#x201c;it&#x201d; is. You know. <i>We all know.</i> You&#x2019;re just making this harder on yourself.In order for pregnancy to occur, someone&#x2019;s sperm had to get up inside you. This may be a little more technical than we need to get, but specifically, it went up your vagina and traveled into your uterus where an egg was waiting to be fertilized, yearning and yearning for a blissful commingling with its partner-to-be. And lo, life was created.<br><b>Other Fluids They May Demand from You</b><b>1.</b> <b>Sweat</b><b>2.</b> <b>Earwax</b><b>3.</b> <b>Cry into this vial!</b><br>Here are a few examples of how pregnancy might have occurred.

Beatific smiles are common, as are tears of joy, or leaping about the woods singing traditional hymns while hunting for small, delicious animals to sacrifice to your god(s). Or maybe you&#x2019;re just sitting there, reading this book while your ankles swell.On the other hand, we have to face the possibility that you weren&#x2019;t trying to get pregnant at all. Perhaps you&#x2019;re entering the first flush of menopause and you assumed it was too late to get pregnant. (Surprise!) Or you thought you were too young to start a family, but now that boyfriend of yours seems awfully pumped about this whole baby deal, which is weird because you&#x2019;re barely out of school and is it just because he can&#x2019;t get over how God made his semen so powerful that it broke through the condom?It&#x2019;s important to know that what you&#x2019;re feeling is entirely normal and correct.

Cats are a known spreader of trichinosis, due to their love of raw pork. Trichinosis is a fatal disease that will turn you fat and hairless before it kill you.

The authors take us to sea with the brave sailors on all sides, nearly overwhelming us with nonstop action and military maneuvers at every word.

In this book even the beginner knows where he is during every step in the process, from the moment he ties in the waxed thread until he ties off the fly with the whip finish knot.<br><br>But unlike the specialized books on fly tying that describe particular types or styles of flies, this book covers them all -- all types of both freshwater and saltwater flies. Whether you are talking about dry flies for trout, streamers for tarpon, or hair bugs for bass, you will find them here. Eric Leiser teaches the basic methods for tying all basic flies. Standard dries? Yes. Hair dries? Yes. Parachute dries? Yes. Hackleless flies? Again yes. Wets, nymphs, streamers, Jassids and other terrestrials, bucktails and Muddlers, Spuddlers and Matukas? Yes, everything! This book provides all the basics for the different types and styles of flies, and patterns are given for the most important flies in each category.<br><br>The drawings are the work of another master fly tier, Dave Whitlock, who knows the processes himself and supplements Leiser's detailed instructions with step-by-step illustrations. In addition, there are clear and useful photographs by Gus Nevros.<br><br>In sum, this is truly The Complete Book of Fly Tying. It will clarify the mysteries for the beginner; it will reveal tricks of the trade for the expert who seeks to improve his method or who wants to tie types of flies he has not attempted before. It also covers, of course, the necessary tools and is filled throughout with immensely helpful discussion of materials, and their special uses and characteristic behavior during the process of tying. And there is specific advice on how to master difficult or obstinate materials such as deer hair, which often baffles beginning tiers of the hair-bodied fly. Throughout, Eric Leiser not only describes each step in detail, but shows how to avoid some all-too-common mistakes.<br><br>This book is a complete education -- and one that will leave you well prepared to tie any kind of fly for any fish taken on the fly rod.</p><p>Eric Leiser, a master fly tier, teacher, and expert on the materials of the craft, is the author of Fly Tying Materials, as well as co-author with Larry Solomon of The Caddis and the Angler, and; with Robert H.

A first novel.</p><p>Seventeen years ago, a jury found Vaun Adams guilty of strangling a six-year-old girl, and sent Vaun to prison. One year ago, an international panel of art critics judged her the century&#39;s greatest woman painter. Now children are dying again in the community of eccentrics where the notorious artist has taken shelter. Katarina Cecilia Martinelli (Casey to her friends, Kate to her few intimates), newly of the SFPD, and Alonzo Hawkin, in charge of the investigation, are charged with finding the truth: Is Vaun a murderess? Or is she the perfect victim?g debut of the Kate Martinelli mystery series won the Edgar Award for Best First Mystery, generating wide critical acclaim and moving Laurie R. King into the upper tier of the genre. As <i>A Grave Talent </i>begins, the unthinkable has happened in a small community outside of San Francisco. A string of shocking murders has occurred, each victim an innocent child. For Detective Kate Martinelli, just promoted to Homicide and paired with a seasoned cop who's less than thrilled to be handed a green partner, it's going to be a difficult case. Then the detectives receive what appears to be a case-breaking lead: it seems that one of the residents of this odd, close-knit colony is Vaun Adams, arguably the century's greatest painter of women, a man, as it turns out, with a sinister secret. For behind the brushes and canvases also stands a notorious felon once convicted of strangling a little girl. What really happened on that day of savage violence eighteen years ago?

They discovered, to their surprise, rare articles of courtly furniture richly worked and inlaid with precious stones and gold. However there was no local furniture that suited the settlers' manner of living, so they commissioned extravagant pieces along European lines from native craftsmen, allowing them free rein with local materials. The resulting fusion of Western furniture forms with Indian materials and decorative techniques gave rise to a wide range of luxury goods - cabinets, games-tables, painted boxes, ceremonial arms - that were breathtaking in their craftsmanship and widely prized in Europe, where they found their way into royal collections, ecclesiastical treasuries and stately houses.<br>The 50 pieces in this volume, dating from the fifteenth to the late nineteenth century, demonstrate all the diversity and skill of Indian craftsmanship and tell a fascinating story about the changing role of domestic objects and their use in the subcontinent. They illustrate the subtle interaction between European and Indian tastes and sensibilities, and chart the course of colonial patronage. Many pieces illustrated here have never been published before, and Amin Jaffer's scholarly yet accessible text throws new light on an astonishingly rich yet largely unexplored tradition.</p><p><b>David Esterly</b> is a professional limewood foliage carver in the Gibbons tradition; he played a key role in the restoration of Hampton Court Palace after the disastrous fire of 1986.

From Mary Lamb, sister of Charles, who in the throes of a nervous breakdown turned on her mother with a kitchen knife, to Freud, Jung, and Lacan, who developed the new women-centered therapies, Lisa Appignanesi&#x2019;s research traces how more and more of the inner lives and emotions of women have become a matter for medics and therapists. Here too is the story of how over the years symptoms and diagnoses have developed together to create fashions in illness and how treatments have succeeded or sometimes failed. <em>Mad, Bad, and Sad</em> takes us on a fascinating journey through the fragile, extraordinary human mind.</p><p>Lisa Appignanesi, is the author of Mad, Bad and Sad: A History of Women and the Mind Doctors and All About Love: Anatomy of an Unruly Emotion. A prize-winning novelist and writer, she is the president of English PEN. She lives in London.Award-winning British novelist Appignanesi (The Memory Man) has written a fascinating if somewhat diffuse study of how, over the past two centuries, women's ability to live creative lives has been controlled by culture, and how their unsuccessful attempts to rebel frequently lead to mental illness-itself a slippery, ever-evolving cultural concept. Appignanesi's sources are wide-ranging but largely literary, based upon letters, diaries, articles and fiction from feminist writers such as Betty Friedan, historians like R.D. Laing and Jacque Lacan, psychologists such as Melanie Klein, and troubled subjects like Zelda Fitzgerald and Marilyn Monroe. Beginning with the lives of mentally ill women in the 19th century, Appignanesi moves chronologically through the history of psychology-as ideas like schizophrenia replace earlier notions of hysteria-and its relationship to the creative woman, using in-depth profiles of Virginia Woolf, Alice James and others. Looking at the complex cultural, political and familial circumstances under which mental illness emerges, and their implications for the present (in which depression and eating disorders have become major problems), Appignanesi convincingly asserts that "symptoms and diagnoses... cluster to create cultural fashions in illness and cure," suggesting provocatively that "what is at issue here is not psychic disorder so much as social deterioration of a radical kind." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The rich variety of tone and colour of the selected artworks help to dispel the myth that etchings can only ever be scratchy black line drawings on white paper.

I mean, you never think of that sort of thing happening in Edinburgh, do you...?&#39; &#39;That sort of thing&#39; is the brutal abduction and murder of two young girls. And now a third is missing, presumably gone to the same sad end. Detective Sergeant John Rebus, smoking and drinking too much, his own young daughter spirited away south by his disenchanted wife, is one of many policemen hunting the killer.

This volume contains contributions from Sir Thomas Wyatt, the Countess of Pembroke, Shakespeare, Donne, Milton, Christopher Smart, Hardy, Isaac Rosenberg and Clive Wilmer among many others, and it includes poems which meditate on David as an alternative to the Ancient Greek figure of Orpheus, and on Ancient Hebrew poetry as an alternative to the Ancient Greek.</p><p></p><h2>Playing Ball on Running Water: The Japanese Way to Building a Better Life</h2><p>Suggests a Zen-influenced technique for reducing self-doubt, overcoming procrastination, and encouraging personal growth through a new aesthetic appreciation of life</p><p></p><h2>Henry James: Complete Stories Vol. 1 1864-1874 (LOA #111) (Library of America Complete Stories of Henry James)</h2><p>&#x201c;A dignified and impressive addition to your bookshelf that reveals James&#x2019;s virtuoso performance in a genre he helped to define, refine and elevate.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>The Commercial Appeal</i><br><br>This Library of America volume, the first of five of Henry James&#x2019;s short fiction, brings together his first twenty-four published stories, thirteen never collected by James.<br><br>Encompassing a wide range of subjects, settings, and formal techniques, they show the first explorations of some of James&#x2019;s most significant themes: the force of social convention and the compromises it demands; the complex and often ambiguous encounter between Europe and America; the energies of passion measured against the rigors of artistic discipline.<br><br>By his mid-twenties, James was a regular contributor to the most prestigious and popular magazines of his era. He is equally at ease writing historical tales, such as &#x201c;Gabrielle de Bergerac,&#x201d; a love story set in pre-Revolutionary France, as he is exploring contemporary events, as in the three stories that treat the effects of the American Civil War on civilians.<br><br>James&#x2019;s psychological acuity is already evident in &#x201c;Master Eustace,&#x201d; a study of the ruthlessness of a spoiled child, and in &#x201c;Guest&#x2019;s Confession,&#x201d; where the comic portrayal of an arrogant businessman hints at his cruelty and self-absorption. In &#x201c;The Romance of Certain Old Clothes,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Last of the Valerii,&#x201d; James begins to work with the supernatural and fantastic motifs that would continue to surface in his work. Early examples of James&#x2019;s lifelong fascination with art and artists include &#x201c;A Landscape Painter,&#x201d; about a young painter&#x2019;s attraction to a seemingly simple family living in a desolate coastal town, and &#x201c;The Madonna of the Future,&#x201d; where an aging artist avoids the unveiling of his masterpiece.<br><br>Adumbrating later triumphs and compelling in their own right, these stories reveal and accomplished and cosmopolitan young talent mastering the art of the short story.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

He spent his early life in America and studied in Geneva, London and Paris during his adolescence to gain the worldly experience so prized by his father. He lived in Newport, went briefly to Harvard Law School, and in 1864 began to contribute both criticism and tales to magazines.<p>In 1869, and then in 1872-74, he paid visits to Europe and began his first novel, <b>Roderick Hudson</b>. Late in 1875 he settled in Paris, where he met Turgenev, Flaubert, and Zola, and wrote <b>The American</b> (1877). In December 1876 he moved to London, where two years later he achieved international fame with <b>Daisy Miller</b>. Other famous works include <b>Washington Square</b> (1880), <b>The Portrait of a Lady</b> (1881), <b>The Princess Casamassima</b> (1886), <b>The Aspern Papers</b> (1888), <b>The Turn of the Screw</b> (1898), and three large novels of the new century, <b>The Wings of the Dove</b> (1902), <b>The Ambassadors</b> (1903) and <b>The Golden Bowl</b> (1904). In 1905 he revisited the United States and wrote <b>The American Scene</b> (1907).</p><p>During his career he also wrote many works of criticism and travel. Although old and ailing, he threw himself into war work in 1914, and in 1915, a few months before his death, he became a British subject. In 1916 King George V conferred the Order of Merit on him. He died in London in February 1916.</p>The Library of America adds two more winners to its ever-growing product line. The Faulkner volume includes The Town (1957), The Mansion (1959), and his last novel, The Reivers: A Reminiscence (1962). The James volume is LOA's fifth and final collection of that author's writings, marking the first time in three decades that his complete canon is in print. This volume gathers 24 of his stories, including "Poor Richard," "A Landscape Painter," and "A Passionate Pilgrim." Both volumes contain notes on the text, a chronology of the author's life, and the other signature extras of the series. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sleeping Late On Judgement Day: A Bobby Dollar Novel</h2><p>Where does an angel go when he's been to Hell and back?<br><br>Renegade angel Bobby Dollar does not have an easy afterlife.

They don&#x2019;t happen that often, for one thing.</p><p><i>But wait, O wise angel</i>, I hear you say. <i>How can there be trials in Heaven?</i></p><p>Which is a perfectly good question, because once you&#x2019;ve made it to the Big Happy you should be golden, right? You&#x2019;ve been judged righteous or you wouldn&#x2019;t get in, and after that you&#x2019;re doing the work of the Highest, so how could you go wrong?</p><p>Well, first of all, there&#x2019;s the whole Free Will thing&#x2014;people and angels have to be free to make mistakes, or else we live in a clockwork universe where everything&#x2019;s predetermined and perfect. Most of the time Heaven does seem like that, a flock of serene shiny creatures living in complete harmony, a hive of buzzing happiness and shared purpose. But we all know that in nature, no matter how well any system works, there&#x2019;s always a couple of dumbass birds heading north for the winter when everyone else is flying south, or one dipshit salmon belly-surfing down the rapids, yelling, &#x201c;Whoo, yeah! Check me out!&#x201d; as he smacks face first into the more sensible fish swimming upstream to spawn. The fact that these unrepresentative idiots freeze and plummet from the sky or die without issue isn&#x2019;t the point&#x2014;the point is Free Will, and apparently we angels are capable of poor impulse control just like everybody else. Thus, there <i>are</i> trials in Heaven, and I was about to attend my first.</p><p>Although &#x201c;attend&#x201d; is a bit misleading, I admit. It wasn&#x2019;t really my first, because I&#x2019;d been aware of several other trials. Here in the Happy Place you can know about important things like that and even follow them closely without actually being present, although it&#x2019;s hard to explain, because&#x2014;duh&#x2014;it&#x2019;s another Heaven thing. Imagine sitting in a crowded bar when the playoffs are on and a local team is involved: you don&#x2019;t have to stay glued to the screen to know what&#x2019;s going on in the game; you can pick up what&#x2019;s happening in a dozen different ways. And that&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;d done my trial-watching in the past.</p><p>But this trial was going to be different, and so I had secured myself an excellent seat, front row center. The poor bastard angel on trial was going to face the full weight of Heaven&#x2019;s judgement, and the entire Shining City was full of anticipation. The Hall of Justice sparkled and throbbed with the light of watching angels, angels who wanted more than just a general feeling about this trial, who wanted to experience it up close and personal. I thought I even saw my boss, Archangel Temuel (who us angelic grunts usually called &#x201c;The Mule&#x201d;) not too far away.</p><p>The crowd of the Saved, jostling each other in the massive shining hall despite being only semi-tangible (another Heaven thing which doesn&#x2019;t really translate), began to murmur with anticipation as the jury appeared, a row of blooming angelic flames that represented the great and the good&#x2014;in fact some of the very greatest and goodest that our Third Sphere had to offer. I recognized them all.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>We Are Convened In The Sight Of The Highest To Do Justice.</i>&#x201d; These words came from the diamond-faceted white light that represented Terentia, a powerful angel who was acting as master of ceremonies. The other four heavenly judges, Karael, Raziel, Anaita, and Chamuel watched silently from beside her, their flames lined up like a menorah on Hanukkah Day Five. &#x201c;<i>God Loves You All</i>,&#x201d; Terentia added, then turned her attention to me. <i>&#x201c;Angel Advocate Doloriel,</i> <i>You Are Accused Of Conspiring Against Heaven&#x2019;s Laws. In Addition To Several Crimes, You Are Also Charged With The Sins Of Wrath, Pride, Envy, And Avarice, All Most Dreadful. If You Are Found Guilty, You Will Be Cast From Heaven And Into The Unholy Pit, There To Dwell In Suffering For Eternity. Do You Have Any Questions Before We Begin?&#x201d;</i></p><p>So, yeah, the reason I had such a good seat was because I was the one on trial. And if you&#x2019;ve got questions, believe me, so did I&#x2014;probably the same ones, in fact, beginning with &#x201c;How did I get here?&#x201d; and &#x201c;How do I get out of here again?&#x201d; But for reasons I&#x2019;ll explain as I go, I didn&#x2019;t think it would do me any good to ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Look, you&#x2019;ve already decided what you&#x2019;re going to do,&#x201d; I said, with what I hoped came off as a tough, cold-blooded calm I sure didn&#x2019;t feel. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s cut to the chase, because we all know the fun part is going to be the sentencing.&#x201d;</p><p><i>But wait,</i> I hear you say. <i>How did you wind up on trial in Heaven, Bobby Dollar? How could such a thing happen to you, one of Heaven&#x2019;s most beloved and respected angels?</i></p><p>Oh, yeah, that&#x2019;s hilarious. Kick a guy when he&#x2019;s on trial for his immortal soul just to get a cheap laugh, why don&#x2019;t you?</p><p>You really want to hear how I wound up here? I guess it started with a dream I had.</p><p></p><p></p><p>one</p><p>just an angel</p><p> </p><p>THE WOOD was stacked higher than the heads of the catcalling spectators. On top of the mountainous pyre, the prisoner sagged against the stake like something unreal, a discarded shop-window dummy or a forgotten toy. The condemned wore a soldier&#x2019;s gleaming armor, but the slightness of the figure told a different story. This was a woman about to be burned. This was St. Joan.</p><p>She lifted her head and looked out across the crowded town square. Our eyes met. I saw the pale white-gold hair, the eyes red as blood, and my heart went cold. This wasn&#x2019;t the Maid of Orleans, it was Caz&#x2014;<i>my</i> Caz, my beautiful demon-woman, the creature who had both captured and endangered my soul.</p><p>Someone set fire to the stacked wood. The kindling caught first, freeing wisps of white smoke that quickly rose and spread around her feet. Within moments the flames began to climb the sides of the pyre, painting the rising smoke with sunset tones. Caz struggled against her bonds, more and more desperate as the fire rose.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t move. I opened my mouth and tried to call to her, but I couldn&#x2019;t speak, either. I was frozen, helpless. When she needed me most, I couldn&#x2019;t do a thing.</p><p><i>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t reach you!&#x201d;</i> she cried, coils of smoke climbing her writhing body like snakes. <i>&#x201c;Oh, Bobby! I can&#x2019;t reach you!&#x201d;</i> Then her words turned to shrieks.</p><p>Flames leaped high into the air, until I could hardly make her out through the shimmer of heat. Her struggling figure, the smoke, the buildings in the background, all bent and wavered as if under water. Then, through the rising, spreading cloud, I saw a clutter in the air above her&#x2014;winged shapes, dropping from the sky.</p><p><i>Hallelujah!</i> The bells of the town began to clang, ringing out the song of redemption. <i>Hallelujah!</i> The winged ones swept down through the smoke&#x2014;angels, angels coming to save her!</p><p>But then I saw the shapes more clearly. Maybe it was the warping of the heated air, but these supposed rescuers looked grim and terrible, eyes lightning-bright, wings black as burnt paper and glowing at the edges as though fire were their natural element.</p><p><i>Angels,</i> I wondered, <i>or demons?</i> Coming to save her&#x2014;or drag her back to endless torment? Paralyzed, silent, I could only watch as the bells grew louder, louder.</p><p><i>Hallelujah!</i></p><p><i>HAH-lay-loo-yah!</i></p><p><i>HAH-lay-loo-yah!</i></p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>I lurched upright, my blanket tangled around me. The room was dark except for a little bit of streetlight creeping in between the cheap curtains. No flames, no smoke, but my phone kept beeping out that horrible joke melody over and over.</p><p><i>HAH-lay-loo-yah!</i></p><p>My phone. It was just my phone.</p><p><i>Yeah,</i> I thought through the pounding of my heart and the slow gathering of my confused thoughts<i>. Fuck you, Handel&#x2014;and your fucking Chorus, too. And fuck whoever in Heaven decided to use it as our ringtone.</i></p><p>After knocking half the crap off my nightstand, I found the phone and then the &#x201c;talk&#x201d; button. The hosanna-ing finally stopped.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; My pulse was banging like I had stumbled off a cliff into empty air. &#x201c;This better be good or someone&#x2019;s gonna die.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone already did.&#x201d; It was Alice from the downtown office&#x2014;our local branch of Heaven&#x2019;s management. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a client, Dollar.&#x201d; She gave me the details like she was reading a shopping list. &#x201c;Go get &#x2019;em, cowboy. And maybe you wouldn&#x2019;t be such a grumpy piece of shit if you didn&#x2019;t drink yourself to sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>She hung up before any witty replies occurred to me.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t reach you!&#x201d; Caz had cried in my dream. And I couldn&#x2019;t reach her, either, because we were separated by much more than distance. One of us was in Hell. The other one only felt that way.</p><p>As I lay there waiting for the morning&#x2019;s first flood of black hopelessness to pass, I heard a scuffling noise on the other side of the wall near my head. I&#x2019;d noticed it earlier when I was going to bed, and had put it down to rats, or possibly one of the neighbors in the adjoining apartment scraping something off the wall. This time it went on for a while, a repetitive <i>skritch-skritch-a-skritch</i> that quickly got on my nerves. Finally I thumped the wall with my fist and everything went silent.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t crazy about my new digs in the downmarket Tierra Green apartments, but things and people that wanted to hurt me kept finding out where I lived, so lately I hadn&#x2019;t been able to stay in any one place for long. And I <i>hate</i> moving.</p><p>Between my girlfriend-on-fire nightmare and the noise in the walls, it took me a good minute or two dunking my head in a sink full of cold water before I could calm down enough to get my mind to focus on work.</p><p><i>Angel advocate</i>, I reminded myself. <i>Somebody needs you.</i></p><p>The client was only a short distance away, out on the Bayshore freeway, but even after I got out of the apartment I couldn&#x2019;t find my car for about ten minutes. Not, I hasten to say, because I had come home drunk (although I might have been a tiny bit fuzzy around the edges) but because after recent experiences with a murderous semi-zombie named Smyler, I&#x2019;d started leaving my ride in a different place every night.</p><p>I felt like I&#x2019;d only managed about ten minutes sleep, but it was almost dawn, which meant I&#x2019;d slept a decent amount: I&#x2019;d passed out almost directly after getting home. Again, not because I&#x2019;d been drinking, although I&#x2019;d probably had a few beers with dinner. (I&#x2019;ve been trying to cut back lately, in fact, be a little more responsible.) No, I was falling asleep at odd hours and forgetting where my car was because I&#x2019;d been sleeping so badly. And I was sleeping badly because I kept dreaming about Hell. See, I&#x2019;d just spent what felt like half a year there, and it was exactly as bad as you&#x2019;d imagine. No, worse. It&#x2019;s not something you just get over in a night. Not to mention the fact that the whole reason I&#x2019;d gone there had been to free the demon-woman I loved, Casimira, the Countess of Cold Hands, and I&#x2019;d failed. Badly. Thus, your pal Bobby&#x2019;s apparently permanent sense of insufficiency, and ugly dreams nearly every night.</p><p>This had been a new one, though, and worse than usual. Usually I just dreamed of Marmora, the fake Caz that the archdemon Eligor had used to sucker me like the smallest small-timer you can imagine, and how she had transformed from Caz into liquid nothing in my arms. Sometimes I also dreamed of the horrible things I&#x2019;d seen happen to Caz while I was being tortured by Eligor, her boss and ex-lover, although I was convinced most of those things hadn&#x2019;t actually happened to her. (I really needed to believe that.) So what had been different about this dream? Caz told me once that when she herself was being executed, she had thought of Joan of Arc, so it only made sense my subconscious would add that nasty wrinkle to the regular pattern of nightmares.</p><p>But there had been something different this time&#x2014;something deeper that I couldn&#x2019;t grasp, almost as though she had truly been trying to communicate with me. But how, why, or about what, I had no clue.</p><p>I found my boxy old Datsun at last, down an alley off Heller Street that I only barely remembered choosing. It was late November but dry and clear, so traffic wasn&#x2019;t too bad even this close to downtown; it took me less than a quarter of an hour to reach the accident scene, just a little way south of the Woodside Expressway cloverleaf. Some kind of minivan with writing on its side lay upside down and badly damaged at the end of a trail of wreckage. Black and whites and emergency vehicles had parked all over the shoulder, lights whipping blue and red. The only body was on the ground, covered with a bloody sheet, and nobody looked like they were in much of a hurry.</p><p>Angel time.</p><p>I left my car on the shoulder about a hundred feet past the accident and walked back through the ice plants. None of the cops gave me a second look as I approached, but that&#x2019;s pretty much how it is: when angels are working, especially at a death scene, we just don&#x2019;t get noticed. Of course, the cops and paramedics were going to see even less of me in a second. When I was within a few yards of the body, I stopped and opened the portal of bright but unsteady light we angels call a Zipper.</p><p>Yes, that&#x2019;s what we call them. Spare me the crude jokes, because believe me, I&#x2019;ve heard them all, mostly from other angels. The Zippers are just an opening we go through to do our work. They&#x2019;re holes in Time, and everything on the other side of them is kind of a bubble made of that single moment.</p><p>The sounds of the freeway died as I stepped through. On the other side, the emergency vehicles and the passing cars, and even the people, had all frozen into place as if a billion gallons of clear plastic had been poured over everything&#x2014;cops halted in mid-gesture, lights frozen at different stages of illumination, an entire universe gone silent as a tomb. Other than me, the only thing moving was a guy in work clothes walking in and out among the motionless cars, pounding on windows, trying to get one of the drivers to notice him. They wouldn&#x2019;t, of course, because he was outside of Time and they were all still inside it.</p><p>He saw me coming and ran toward me. He had a thick mustache and dark skin, but all I could really focus on were the terrified whites of his eyes. &#x201c;Help me!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;I have had an accident!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gurdeep Malhotra,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;God loves you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; he asked, stumbling to a stop.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Doloriel, your angelic advocate.&#x201d; I gave him a moment for that to sink in. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid you didn&#x2019;t survive your accident.&#x201d;</p><p>He stared. If blood had still been flowing in his veins, I&#x2019;d have said he went pale. As it was, he seemed to lose resolution for a moment as the shock washed through him. &#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I can&#x2019;t! My son! It&#x2019;s his&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He shook his head slowly. &#x201c;My wife! Will I never see her again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot I can&#x2019;t tell you,&#x201d; I said as kindly as I could. In fact, there&#x2019;s a whole lot I don&#x2019;t know myself. &#x201c;But first we have to prepare you for judgement. That&#x2019;s my job. I will do everything I can to defend you.

In La Maison de Rendez-vous, the master of the &#34;new novel&#34; creates a world of crime, intrigue, and passion dominated by Lady Ava&#39;s mysterious Blue Villa. Set in Hong Kong, the novella unfolds over the course of one evening, but the events of that night recur repeatedly, from the perspectives of different characters. Robbe-Grillet creates an unsettling work that challenges ideas about subjectivity and objectivity, fiction and fact, and the entire process of storytelling. A haunting, disorienting, and brilliantly constructed novel, Djinn is the story of a young man who joins a clandestine organization under the command of an alluring, androgynous American girl named Djinn. His search for the meaning of his mission and for possible clues to the identity of the mysterious Djinn, becomes a quest for his own identity in an ever-shifting time-space continuum.</p><p>With Hong Kong as the setting, the master of the "new novel" creates a world of crime, intrigue, and passion dominated by Lady Ava's mysterious Blue Villa. The novella unfolds over the course of only one evening, but the events of that night recur repeatedly, and the same moments are described from the perspectives of different characters. Robbe-Grillet creates an unsettling work that challenges his readers' ideas about subjectivity and objectivity, fiction and fact, and the entire process of story-telling. Djinn <p>A haunting, disorienting, brilliantly constructed novel, Djinn is the story of a young man who joins a clandestine organization under the command of an alluring, androgynous American girl, Djinn. Having agreed to wear dark glasses and carry a cane like a blind man, he comes to realize, through bizarre encounters, recurring visual images, and fractured time sequences he experiences as part of his undisclosed mission, that he is, in a sense, helplessly blind. His search for the meaning of his mission and for possible clues to the identity of the mysterious Djinn, becomes a quest for his own identity in an ever-shifting time-space continuum. His growing obsession with solving the mystery becomes the reader's own until, through a surprising shift in narrative perspective, the reader too becomes lost in the dimension between past and future. </p><p>"Alain Robbe-Grillet is the forerunner of a revolution in the novel."--Claude Mauriac </p><p>"[La Maison de Rendez-vous is] a new literary entertainment, and a poetic, amusing, captivating book."--The New York Times Book Review </p><p>"[La Maison de Rendez-vous] is a funny book, a provocation, a do-it-yourself mystery or a fairy tale."--Eliot Fremont-Smith, The New York Times </p><p>"Djinn may win a whole generation over to the noveau roman."--International Herald Tribune </p><p>"Robbe-Grillet is at the top of his form with this fantastic tale."--Le Monde </p><p>Alain Robbe-Grillet, born in 1922, is one of the most discussed and controversial writers of the post-war era.

Her first novel, Some Tame Gazelle, was published in 1950, and was followed by Excellent Women (1952), Jane and Prudence (1953), Less than Angels (1955), A Glass of Blessings (1958) and No Fond Return of Love (1961). During the sixties and early seventies her writing suffered a partial eclipse and, discouraged, she concentrated on her work for the International African Institute, from which she retired in 1974 to live in Oxfordshire. A renaissance in her fortunes came in 1977, when both Philip Larkin and Lord David Cecil chose her as one of the most underrated novelists of the century. With astonishing speed, she emerged, after sixteen years of obscurity, to almost instant fame and recognition. Quartet in Autumn was published in 1977 and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. The Sweet Dove Died followed in 1978, and A Few Green Leaves was published posthumously. Barbara Pym died in January, 1980. For more information, please go to: hazelholt.coffeetownpress.com.Pym's reputation will not be enhanced by the publication of this edited first draft of a novel from her "silent years." Set in a provincial university, the story is narrated by Caro Grimstone, the dissatisfied wife of Alan, a rising anthropologist. Caro unwittingly becomes the means by which Alan dishonestly obtains a manuscript that will both advance his reputation and refute the findings of a respected, elderly colleague. Around this academic misdemeanor, the Grimstones and a cast of unrealized academic eccentrics revolve until the whole is resolved in a literal burst of fireworks. Absent is Pym's genius for creating characters whose concerns, no matter how trivial, engage the reader. Her fans, however, will probably demand the book. Andrea Caron Kempf, Johnson Cty.

He then gained prominence as an expert on tax havens, revealing the dark corners of that world long before the scandals of the Panama and Paradise Papers. Now, in <i>The Finance Curse</i>, revised with chapters exclusive to this American edition, he takes us on a terrifying journey through the world economy, exposing tax havens, monopolists, megabanks, private equity firms, Eurobond traders, lobbyists, and a menagerie of scoundrels quietly financializing our entire society, hurting both business and individuals.<p> Shaxson shows we got here, telling the story of how finance re-engineered the global economic order in the last half-century, with the aim not of creating wealth but extracting it from the underlying economy. Under the twin gospels of &#x201c;national competitiveness&#x201d; and &#x201c;shareholder value,&#x201d; megabanks and financialized corporations have provoked a race to the bottom between states to provide the most subsidized environment for big business, have encouraged a brain drain into finance, and have fostered instability, inequality, and turned a blind eye to the spoils of organized crime. From Ireland to Iowa, Shaxson shows the insidious effects of financialization on our politics and on communities who were promised paradise but got poverty wages instead. </p><p> We need a strong financial system&#x2015;but when it grows too big it becomes a monster. <i>The Finance Curse</i> is the explosive story of how finance got a stranglehold on society, and reveals how we might release ourselves from its grasp.</p></p><p><b>Nicholas Shaxson</b> is the author of <i>Treasure Islands: Tax Havens and the Men who Stole the World</i> and <i>Poisoned Wells: The Dirty Politics of African Oil</i>.

He lives in Germany.<b>Praise for <i>The Finance Curse</i>:</b><p> &#x201c;Excoriating . . .

Shaxson leavens the mix with some great writing.&#x201d;&#x2015;<b>John Arlidge, <i>Sunday Times</i></b></p><p> &#x201c;The problem outlined in this book has deep roots and it shows no signs of going away. The &#x2018;finance curse&#x2019; pervades many Western economies, from tiny tax havens to big countries like Britain with outsize financial sectors . . . Shaxson offers plenty of examples which take the breath away. In an engagingly chatty style he reels off anecdotes and thumbnail sketches of the most villainous: from John D. Rockefeller and John Pierpont Morgan at the start, to more modern examples, such as Michael Milken the junk bond king and the geniuses at JP Morgan who first devised credit derivatives . . . Shaxson believes that financialization and the finance curse should be stopped, and that finance should be returned to its proper place, serving society.

Unlike Vince Staten (see below), Gregory (an Oklahoma-based broadcaster) does not essay a full-dress Dean portrait. Instead, he focuses on Dean's baseball career, which began on the sandlots of the American Southwest and ended in mid-1941, when an old injury forced the pitcher into retirement at age 31. In the comparatively few years that he played in the major leagues, Dizzy (a nickname the St. Louis Cardinal right-hander acquired during a stint in the US Army) accomplished more than enough to boost himself into the Hall of Fame--for example, winning 30 games (while his younger brother Paul posted 19 victories) during the 1934 season, and going on to split with Paul the four wins needed to vanquish the Detroit Tigers in the World Series. While Dean was a superstar on the mound (and, often, at bat or on the basepaths), the author leaves little doubt that he could be very hard to take--off as well as on the field. A headstrong showoff and braggart, the flaky hurler was given to explosive tantrums when denied his own way. Nor was he greatly esteemed by either club officials or his fellow members of the Gas House Gang, let alone opponents. Paradoxically, perhaps, Dean bore up well under adversity, soldiering on with considerable grace in the wake of a freak accident that devastated his overpowering fastball and induced an old adversary, Branch Rickey, to trade him to the Chicago Cubs. Gregory devotes only cursory attention to Dizzy's impoverished youth, apparently happy marriage, and postbaseball years, when he achieved national popularity as a radio/TV personality. Nonetheless, his like-it-was account should appeal to fans who delight in the summer game's bygone glories. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Beginning in 1947 at the time of Independence and produced during six extended visits over a twenty-year period, these beautiful, dramatic images are shaped by an eye and a mind legendary for their intelligent empathy and for going to the heart of the matter.<br><br>Cartier-Bresson's extraordinary gifts of observation and his famous "mantle of invisibility," as well as his good connections with Jawaharlal Nehru and others, allowed him to capture the quintessence of India. His pictures of Hindus in refugee camps after the Partition or beggars in Calcutta speak with the same passion and authority as those of the Maharaja of Baroda's sumptuous birthday celebrations or of the Mountbattens on the steps of Government House. Ample space is given to his famous reportages, such as the astonishing sequence on the death and cremation of Gandhi. But above all, it is the apparently ordinary faces and scenes from market, temple, or countryside that have the power to put us in direct touch with the spirit of a country and its people. 105 duotone illustrations.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Sweetgrass</h2><p>Sweetgrass by Mary Alice Monroe released on Jun 28, 2005 is available now for purchase.</p><p>Mary Alice Monroe is a <em>New York Times</em> and <em>USA TODAY</em> bestselling author of thirteen novels.

On any given day, seemingly by whim, the weather is balmy and sweet-smelling and can lure reluctant smiles from the hopeful who dream of cool, tart drinks on steamy afternoons, creamy white magnolia blossoms and scented offshore breezes. Then overnight, everything can change. With a sudden gust of cold wind, winter will reach out with its icy grip to draw a foggy curtain over the gray marsh.<br><br>Mama June Blakely had hoped for an early spring, but she was well seasoned and had learned to keep an eye on the sky for dark clouds. A leaden mist hovered close to the water, so thick that Mama June could barely make out Blakely's Bluff, which stretched out into the gray-green Atlantic Ocean like a defiant fist. A bittersweet smile eased across her lips. She'd always thought it a fitting symbol of her family's turbulent history with the sea.<br><br>Perched high on the bluff was a weather-beaten house that had been in the Blakely family for generations. Bluff House had withstood countless hurricanes and storms to remain the bastion of family gatherings long after most of the old Charleston family's land holdings were sold off. Each time Mama June looked at the battered house, waves of memories crashed against her stony composure. And when the wind gusted across the marshes, as it did now, she thought the mist swirled like ghosts dancing on the tips of cordgrass.<br><br>Thunder rumbled, low and threatening. She tugged her sweater closer to her neck and shifted her gaze to the lowering skies. Weather moved quickly over the South Carolina coastline, and a front like that could bring a quick cloudburst and sudden winds. Worry tugged at her mouth as she turned on her heel and made her way across the polished floors of her home, through the large, airy kitchen, the stocked butler's pantry, the formal dining room with glistening crystal and mirrors, the front parlor appointed with ancestral furniture and straight out to the front veranda. Gripping the porch railing, she leaned far forward, squinting as she searched the length of ancient roadbed bordered by centuries-old oaks.<br><br>Her frown lifted when she spotted a broad, snowy-headed figure walking up the drive, a lanky black dog at his heels. Mama June leaned against the porch pillar, sighing in relief. At that pace, she figured Preston would beat the storm. How many years had she watched and waited for her husband to come in from the fields? Goodness, could it really be nearing fifty years?<br><br>Preston Blakely wasn't a large man physically, but his manner and personality made him imposing to anyone who knew him. People called him formidable in polite company, bullheaded in familiar&#x2014;and she couldn't argue. He was walking with a single-minded purpose, heels digging in the soft roadbed and arms swinging. His square chin jutted out, cutting the wind like the mast of a ship.<br><br>Lord, what bee was in that man's britches this time? she thought with a sorry shake of her head.<br><br>On reaching the house, Preston sent the dog to the back with a jerk of his index finger. "Go on, now. Settle, Blackjack," he ordered. Then, raising his head, he caught Mama June's gaze.<br><br>"Hellfire," he grumbled louder than the thunder, raising his arm and shaking a fistful of crumpled papers in the air. "They've gone and done it this time."<br><br>Mama June's hands tightened on the railing as her husband came up the porch stairs. "Done what?"<br><br>"They done got me by the short hairs," he said on reaching the porch.<br><br>"Who got you, dear?"<br><br>"The banks!" he roared. "The taxes. The whole cussed economy, that's who!"<br><br>"Sit down a spell, Press, before you pop a valve. Look at you. You're sweating under that slicker. It's too hot for such a fuss and, I swanny&#x2014;" she waved her small hand in the air "&#x2014;I don't know what you're talking about. Taxes and banks and short hairs..."<br><br>"I'm talking about this place!"<br><br>"There's no need to shout. I'm old, not deaf."<br><br>"Then listen to what I'm tellin' you, woman. We're going to lose it."<br><br>"What? Lose the land?"<br><br>"Yes, ma'am, the land," he said. "And this house you're so fond of. We'll lose it all."<br><br>"Press," she replied, striving for calm. "I don't understand any of this. How can we lose everything?"<br><br>Preston leaned against the railing and looked out over his land. A cool wind rippled the wild grasses like waves upon the ocean.<br><br>"Remember when we were reassessed a few months past?" When she nodded, he continued. "Well, here's what they say this property is worth now. And here's how much they say we've got to pay. Go on," he said, waving the papers before her. "Read it and weep."<br><br>Mama June reached out to retrieve the crumpled papers and gingerly unfolded them. Her mouth slipped open in a soft gasp. "But...this can't be right. It's three times as much as before."<br><br>"Four times as much."<br><br>"We can't afford that. We'll appeal. They can't force us to accept this."<br><br>"They can and they will."<br><br>"There are lots of folks round here that won't stand for it," Mama June said, hearing aloud the indignation she felt stirring in her breast. "This can't just be happening to us."<br><br>"That's true enough. It's happening all over. And there's nothing any of us can do. Folks keep coming from the north in a steady stream." He shrugged. "And they all want to live along the water for the beautiful views. Trouble is, there's only so much property to go around. So property values just keep climbing and developers, like my own sweet, avaricious sister, are licking their chomps just biding their time. They'll wrestle away any and every acre of earth so they can turn around and plow it over with cement." He raked his thick, short white hair with his fingers. "Hell, I knew it was coming&#x2014;we all did. I reckon I just didn't think it would be so quick."<br><br>He gave a rueful smile. "Kinda like a hurricane, eh? Well," he said with resignation, "looks like we miscalculated on this one. Just like we did with Hugo."<br><br>"We've always managed to hang on before. Through the war, the gas crisis, the bad economy, even Hurricane Hugo."<br><br>"I know it. I've done my best&#x2014;God knows I've fought the good fight. But I'm old now. And I'm worn out. I don't have it in me to fight them anymore."<br><br>Mama June stepped forward to rest her hand on his drooping shoulder, alarmed to her core to see her usual bear of a husband so defeated. She was about to offer some platitude, to say "don't worry, we'll be fine," when she felt his shoulders cord up again beneath her palms. He exploded in renewed fury.<br><br>"Maybe if that no-good son of ours had stayed home we wouldn't be in this mess."<br><br>Mama June dropped her hand and wrapped her arms around herself. "Let's don't start in on Morgan..."<br><br>"Don't you go defending him," he said, whirling around to face her. "Not to me! He's my son, dammit. He should be here, helping his father run this plantation. It's too much for one man. I need his ideas, his energy. Is it too much to ask my only son to take his father's place?"<br><br>"He needs to take his own place in the world," she countered softly, even as she felt herself harden against her husband. This was an all-too-familiar argument.<br><br>"The hell with the world! It's Sweetgrass that needs him. It's his duty. His heritage! A Blakely has run Sweetgrass Plantation for eight generations, and though there may only be a few hundred acres left, by God, Sweetgrass is still in Blakely hands."<br><br>"He's got his own land," she reminded him.<br><br>"His own land?" Preston's eyes widened with incredulity. "You mean those few measly acres in the wilds of Montana that he hides out in when he's not out breaking some laws?"<br><br>"Oh, for pity's sake. He's not doing any such thing. He's protesting!"<br><br>"And for what? To protect some bison? Hell," he said with a snort. <em>"Bison...</em>He grew up calling them buffalo like the rest of us."<br><br>"He's trying to protect them."<br><br>"He's playing around. He's not working that land. He's not working, period."<br><br>"Stop, Press." His angry words were shredding her composure like razors.<br><br>"Worthless," he muttered, ignoring her.<br><br>She turned and began walking away. "I can't listen to this...."<br><br>"What did I bother working for all these years?" he called after her. "That's what I want to know. I have no one to pass this all down to."<br><br>She stopped and faced him with a cold stare. "You have your daughter."<br><br>Preston scoffed and brushed away the suggestion with a sweep of his hand.<br><br>"You can't keep brushing Nan aside."<br><br>"Didn't she do just that to us when she sold off her land?"<br><br>"Her husband..."<br><br>"That weasel! He only married her for her land."<br><br>"What a thing to say!" She'd thought as much herself but had never granted it voice. "Lest you forget, I sold my land when I married you."<br><br>"That wasn't the same thing at all, and you know it."<br><br>"I know no such thing."<br><br>"See, there you go. You always take their sides over mine."<br><br>"I do no&#x2014;"<br><br>"I'm your husband! <em>I </em>should be your first concern. For once! I've worked all these years like a bull in the harness to keep this land intact, to keep hold of this house with all those antiques you love so much."<br><br>"Don't even..."<br><br>"All of this." His arm swept out in a grand gesture. "I've sweated from dawn to dusk. I've spilled blood. I've given my heart and soul to this place. My dreams. My youth. And now..." He stopped, clamping his lips tight and looking out at the land with desperation shining moistly in his eyes. "And now it's gone."<br><br>"Good!" she replied with heart.<br><br>Preston spun around to look at her. "What'd you say?"<br><br>"You heard me. I <em>said good. </em>Good riddance!" she cried out with a strained voice. She saw the pale blue of his eyes swimming with pain and shock at her outburst. But rather than take it back or soften the words, as she ordinarily might have done, she felt years of anguish burst forth with a volcanic gush.<br><br>"All you think about is the loss of this <em>land!" </em>she cried, thrusting the papers into the paunch of his belly. "What about your family? What about that loss? You haven't spoken with your son in years. Your daughter feels like a pariah. They don't come around anymore. You've <em>driven </em>our children away. But you don't care about that, do you? You didn't fight to keep the family, did you? All you care about is this piece of earth. Well, it won't be long before we'll die and be buried on this precious land. But who will mourn our passing? I ask you, Preston, will our children weep when we're gone?"<br><br>His face went still before he swung his head away, averting his gaze.<br><br>She took a breath to gather her strength and stepped closer to her husband, narrowing the distance. Pounding her breast with her fist, emphasizing each word, she said in a voice betrayed by a shaky timbre, "This land has stolen my children from me. And that is a far greater loss to me. Good riddance, I say. I despise this land!"<br><br>"You don't mean that." Preston's voice was low and husky.<br><br>She took a long, sweeping glance at the landscape she'd called home for close to five decades. The roiling line of clouds rolled overhead like the closing of a curtain. Then she met his gaze and held it.<br><br>"I surely do. From the day I first stepped foot on it, all this land ever brought me was utter and complete heartbreak."<br><br>They stood face-to-face, silently recollecting the wide swath of years cut low by that statement.<br><br>Around them the storm broke. Fat drops of rain splattered loudly on the dry ground in gaining crescendo. With each gust of wind the grasses swayed and shook, rattling like castanets. Then the sky opened up and the heavens cried. The roof provided no shelter from the torrents of rain, and both felt the lash of water that whipped through the air.<br><br>Mama June doubted the rain hid from Preston the tears coursing a trail down her cheeks. Yet he did not move to console her or offer any word of either argument or comfort. Her shoulders slumped and she retreated inside the house.<br><br>Preston stood rock still and watched her go. He was unmov-ing as he listened to his wife's tread on the stairs, knowing she made her way to her bedroom. She would likely cloister herself for hours, perhaps for the rest of the evening, shutting him out.<br><br>Same as always.<br><br>He wouldn't go after her, wouldn't try to talk things through lest the words dredged up the past. She couldn't handle that, and he didn't know if <em>he </em>could anymore, either. Besides, it wasn't worth the risk of her retreating to a place far more inaccessible than her bedroom.<br><br>He sighed heavily, her name slipping through his lips. "Mary June..."<br><br>He'd spoken harshly and was sorry for it. She was delicate when it came to matters of the family. He'd always tried to shelter her from bad news. But this...He squeezed the papers once more in his fist. <em>This </em>had hit too hard. He couldn't bear this alone. Hellfire, he'd needed someone to share this burden with, and who better than his wife? She <em>was </em>his wife, wasn't she?<br><br>He cast a final glance up toward her room, where she was crying, and knew a sudden pain, as if the lightning in the sky just shot through his heart.<br><br>"To hell with it!" he cried, drawing back his hand and throwing the cursed papers into the storm.<br><br>The wind caught the papers, hurtling them toward the marsh faster than a Cooper's hawk. They landed, tangled in the tall grasses, beaten by the rain. Lightning flashed in the blackening sky, and by the time he heard the rumble of thunder, he was in the house, reaching for the snifter of brandy.<br><br>The storm passed quickly on its march from the mainland to the sea. Now the air was fresh and the pastel pinks of the sunset had deepened to a rich ocher. Preston sat on the porch, his clothes damp and his skin cold, staring out at the purpling sky while the brandy did its work. Usually Mama June sat rocking beside him in a companionable silence. He felt her absence deeply.<br><br>"At least you're here, aren't you, boy?" he said, reaching down to pat the black Labrador retriever curled at his feet. Blackjack, who had sneaked back onto the porch the moment Mama June left, raised his dark, melting eyes and gazed at Preston with devotion while his tail thumped with affection.

Only now is her complete <i>oeuvre</i>--all 1,775 poems--available in its original form, uncorrupted by editorial revision, in one volume. Thomas H. Johnson, a longtime Dickinson scholar, arranged the poems in chronological order as far as could be ascertained (the dates for more than 100 are unknown). This organization allows a wide-angle view of Dickinson's poetic development, from the sometimes-clunky rhyme schemes of her juvenilia, including valentines she wrote in the early 1850s, to the gloomy, hell-obsessed writings from her last years. Quite a difference from requisite Dickinson entries in literary anthologies: "There's a certain Slant of light," "Wild Nights--Wild Nights!" and "I taste a liquor never brewed."<p> The book was compiled from Thomas H. Johnson's hard-to-find variorum from 1955. While some explanatory notes would have been helpful, it's a prodigious collection, showcasing Dickinson's intractable obsession with nature, including death. Poem 1732, which alludes to the deaths of her father and a onetime suitor, illustrates her talent:</p><p> My life closed twice before its close;<br> It yet remains to see<br> If Immortality unveil<br> A third event to me,<br></p><p> So huge, so hopeless to conceive<br> As these that twice befell.<br> Parting is all we know of heaven,<br> And all we need of hell.</p><p> The musicality of her punctuation and the outright elegance of her style--akin to Christina Rossetti's hymns, although not nearly so religious--rescue the poems from their occasional abstruseness. <i>The Complete Poems</i> is especially refreshing because Dickinson didn't write for publication; only 11 of her verses appeared in magazines during her lifetime, and she had long-resigned herself to anonymity, or a "Barefoot-Rank," as she phrased it. This is the perfect volume for readers wishing to explore the works of one of America's first poets.</p>R. W. Franklin was Director of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University.

And the fast food industry definitely loves kids. It couldn&#x2019;t survive without them. Did you know that the biggest toy company in the world is McDonald&#x2019;s? It&#x2019;s true. In fact, one out of every three toys given to a child in the United States each year is from a fast food restaurant.</p><p>Not only has fast food reached into the toy industry, it&#x2019;s moving into our schools. One out of every five public schools in the United States now serves brand name fast food. But do kids know what they&#x2019;re eating? Where do fast food hamburgers come from? And what makes those fries taste so good? </p><p>When Eric Schlosser&#x2019;s best-selling book, Fast Food Nation, was published for adults in 2001, many called for his groundbreaking insight to be shared with young people. Now Schlosser, along with co-writer Charles Wilson, has investigated the subject further, uncovering new facts children need to know. </p><p>In Chew On This, they share with kids the fascinating and sometimes frightening truth about what lurks between those sesame seed buns, what a chicken &#x2018;nugget&#x2019; really is, and how the fast food industry has been feeding off children for generations.</p><p>Featuring cover art by M. Wartella.</p></p><p><p>Charles Wilson grew up in West Virginia and has written for several newspapers and magazines, including the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em>. He has worked on the staff of <em>The New Yorker</em> and the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> and has rounded up beef cattle on horseback at his uncle&#x2019;s ranch.</p><p>Pull open the glass door and feel the rush of cool air. Step inside. Look at the backlit color pictures of food above the counter, look at the cardboard ads for the latest Disney movie, get in line, and place your order. Hand over some money. Put the change back in your pocket. Watch teenagers in blue-and- gold uniforms busy working in the kitchen. Moments later, grab the plastic tray with your food, find an empty table, and sit down. Unwrap the burger, squirt ketchup on the fries, stick the plastic straw through the hole in the lid of your drink. Pick up the burger and dig in.</p> <p>The whole experience of eating at a fast-food restaurant has become so familiar, so routine, that we take it for granted. It has become just another habit, like brushing your teeth before bed. We do it without even thinking about it&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s the problem.</p> <p>Every day about one out of fourteen Americans eats at a McDonald&#x2019;s. Every month about nine out of ten American children visit one. McDonald&#x2019;s has become the most popular fast-food chain in the world&#x2014;and by far the most powerful. In 1968 there were about 1,000 McDonald&#x2019;s restaurants, all of them in the United States. Now there are more than 31,000 McDonald&#x2019;s, selling Happy Meals in 120 countries, from Istanbul, Turkey, to Papeete, Tahiti. In the United States, McDonald&#x2019;s buys more processed beef, chicken, pork, apples, and potatoes than any other company. It spends more money on advertising and marketing than any other company that sells food. As a result, it is America&#x2019;s most famous food brand. The impact of McDonald&#x2019;s on the way we live today is truly mind-boggling. The Golden Arches are now more widely recognized than the Christian cross.</p> <p>Despite McDonald&#x2019;s fame and all the money it spends on advertising, every day the vast majority of its customers don&#x2019;t plan to eat there. Most fast-food visits are impulsive. The decision to buy fast food is usually made at the last minute, without much thought. People generally don&#x2019;t leave the house in the morning saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to make sure to eat some fast food today.&#x201d; Most of the time, they&#x2019;re just walking down the sidewalk or driving down the road, not thinking about anything in particular. Maybe they&#x2019;re hungry; maybe they&#x2019;re not. Maybe they&#x2019;re in a hurry and don&#x2019;t have time to cook. And then they see a great big fast-food sign&#x2014;the Golden Arches, the red-and-blue of a Domino&#x2019;s pizza box, the picture of Colonel Sanders&#x2014;and they suddenly think, &#x201c;Hey, I want some of that.&#x201d; So they stop to eat fast food. They do it because they feel like it. They just can&#x2019;t resist the impulse.</p> <p>The point of this book is to take that strong impulse we all feel&#x2014; our hunger for sweet, salty, fatty fast foods&#x2014;and make you think about it. Chew On This will tell you where fast food comes from, who makes it, what&#x2019;s in it, and what happens when you eat it. This is a book about fast food and the world it has made.</p> <p>Food is one of the most important things you&#x2019;ll ever buy. And yet most people never bother to think about their food and where it comes from. People spend a lot more time worrying about what kind of blue jeans to wear, what kind of video games to play, what kind of computers to buy. They compare the different models and styles, they talk to friends about the various options, they read as much as they can before making a choice. But those purchases don&#x2019;t really matter. When you get tired of old blue jeans, video games, and computers, you can just give them away or throw them out.</p> <p>The food you eat enters your body and literally becomes part of you. It helps determine whether you&#x2019;ll be short or tall, weak or strong, thin or fat. It helps determine whether you will enjoy a long, healthy life or die young. Food is of fundamental importance. So why is it that most people don&#x2019;t think about fast food and don&#x2019;t know much about it?</p> <p>The simple answer is this: the companies that sell fast food don&#x2019;t want you to think about it. They don&#x2019;t want you to know where it comes from and how it&#x2019;s made. They just want you to buy it.</p> <p>Have you ever seen a fast-food ad that shows the factories where French fries are made? Ever seen a fast-food ad that shows the slaughterhouses where cattle are turned into ground beef? Ever seen an ad that tells you what&#x2019;s really in your fast-food milk shake and why some strange-sounding chemicals make it taste so good? Ever seen an ad that shows overweight, unhealthy kids stuffing their faces with greasy fries at a fast-food restaurant? You probably haven&#x2019;t. But you&#x2019;ve probably seen a lot of fast-food commercials that show thin, happy children having a lot of fun.</p> <p>People have been eating since the beginning of time. But they&#x2019;ve only been eating Chicken McNuggets since 1983. Fast food is a recent invention. During the past thirty years, fast food has spread from the United States to every corner of the globe. A busssssiness that began with a handful of little hot dog and hamburger stands in southern California now sells the all- American meal&#x2014;a hamburger, French fries, and soda&#x2014;just about everywhere. Fast food is now sold at restaurants and drive-throughs, at baseball stadiums, high schools, elementary schools, and universities, on cruise ships, trains, and airplanes, at Kmarts, Wal-Marts, and even the cafeterias of children&#x2019;s hospitals. In 1970, Americans spent about $6 billion on fast food. In 2005, they spent about $134 billion on fast food. Americans now spend more money on fast food than on college education, personal computers, computer software, or new cars. They spend more on fast food than on movies, books, magazines, newspapers, and recorded music&#x2014; combined.</p> <p>Fast food may look like the sort of food people have always eaten, but it&#x2019;s different. It&#x2019;s not the kind of food you can make in your kitchen from scratch. Fast food is something radically new. Indeed, the food we eat has changed more during the past thirty years than during the previous thirty thousand years.</p> <p>In the pages that follow, you&#x2019;ll learn how the fast-food business got started. You&#x2019;ll learn how the fast-food chains try to get kids into their restaurants, how they treat kids working in their kitchens, how they make their food. And you&#x2019;ll learn what can happen when you eat too much of it. These are things you really need to know. Why? Because fast food is heavily advertised to kids and often prepared by workers who are kids themselves. This is an industry that both feeds and feeds off the young. </p><p>For the most part, fast food tastes pretty good. That&#x2019;s one of the main reasons people like to eat it. Fast food has been carefully designed to taste good. It&#x2019;s also inexpensive and convenient. But the Happy Meals, two- for-one deals, and free refills of soda give a false sense of how much fast food actually costs. The real price never appears on the menu. </p><p>Hundreds of millions of people eat fast food every day without giving it much thought. They just unwrap their hamburgers and dig in. An hour or so later, when the burger&#x2019;s all gone and the wrapper&#x2019;s been tossed into the garbage, the whole meal has already been forgotten. Chew on this: people should know what lies beneath the shiny, happy surface of every fast-food restaurant. They should know what really lurks between those sesame seed buns. As the old saying goes: you are what you eat. </p><p>CHEW ON THIS: EVERYTHING YOU DON&#x2019;T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT FAST FOOD by Eric Schlosser and Charles Wilson. Copyright (c) 2006 by Eric Schlosser.

It was a land with a vibrant political and cultural history, unlike any other in Europe, where great powers and religions-the empires of Rome, Charlemagne, the Ottomans; the faiths of Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Judaism, and Islam overlapped and combined. In this first English-language history of Bosnia, Noel Malcolm provides a narrative chronicle of the country from its beginnings to its tragic end. Clarifying the various myths that have clouded the modern understanding of Bosnia's past, Malcolm brings to light the true causes of the country's destruction: the political strategy of the Serbian leadership, the conflict between the city and the countryside, the fatal inaction and miscalculations of Western politicians.

This candid, epic autobiography charts his political "awakening" through a career that spanned the roles of intelligence agent, ambassador calling on Peron, Kennedy and Castro, and deputy foreign minister. Spasowski writes that "people's Poland" is a myth; a handful of Warsaw bureaucrats backed by police power and Soviet might control an entire people. But as the dutiful son of an eminent Polish Marxist, the author was slow to change his thinking. Some of the book's most moving sections recreate his adolescent years in Nazi-occupied Poland, where he saw with disbelief that both Russians and Germans persecuted Poles. With ruthless honesty he divulges a love affair that nearly wrecked his marriage. Later sections describe how Solidarity missed opportunities to consolidate its power. Spasowski's odyssey is told with great literary skill and spiked with instructive disclosures about Poland's ruling elite.

Transferred to an experimental low-security "honor camp" in the redwood forest, he spent six months clearing brush and immersing himself in the life of the jail community, attempting to "bring light and color" to it. "This is crazier here than the nuthouse ever was," Kesey noted, and proceeded to record the scene in numerous notebooks, illustrated with intense and brilliantly colored artwork.<p>Upon returning to Oregon, Kesey turned the raw notebook material into an illustrated collage that stretched across dozens of 18" x 23" boards. Upon realizing that publication of the elaborate, handwritten book was more than his publisher was willing to attempt, he put it aside. Almost thirty years later he returned to the project and brought it to completion during the final years of his life. Fans of Ken Kesey's singular American voice will rejoice to hear it again in this unique and long-overdue volume. Those unfamiliar with Kesey's artwork are in for a revelation.</p></p><p><b>Ken Kesey</b> was born in 1935 and grew up in Oregon. He graduated from the University of Oregon and later studied at Stanford with Wallace Stegner, Malcolm Cowley, Richard Scowcroft, and Frank O' Connor. <b>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</b>, his first novel, was published in 1962. His second novel, <b>Sometimes a Great Notion</b>, followed in 1964. His other books include <b>Kesey's Garage Sale</b>, <b>Demon Box</b>, <b>Caverns</b> (with O. U.

Ken Kesey died on November 10, 2001.Cut &#x2018;em Loose!An introduction by Ed McClanahanIn early November 2001, while Ken Kesey lay dying in an Oregon hospital, I was talking to his brother Chuck about the possibility that he might pull through somehow. Taking the optimistic view, I told Chuck about a little incident that had happened several years earlier, when I was visiting Ken just after a stroke had left his right arm and hand temporarily paralyzed. Ken was attempting to pick up a small piece of paper off the desk in his office, and his hand was refusing to cooperate.&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, hand!&#x201d; he commanded the offending extremity. &#x201c;Work!&#x201d;&#x201c;And sure enough,&#x201d; I told Chuck, &#x201c;his hand grabbed up that slip of paper so fast you could almost hear the hand squeak, &#x2018;Okay, boss! Okay!&#x2019; So I think if anybody could will himself to get well again, it&#x2019;d be Ken.&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s happening,&#x201d; Chuck said. &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s lookin&#x2019; down that long, dark tunnel, and he sees that bright little light down there, and now he&#x2019;s headed for it.&#x201d;That would be like him, I had to admit. That would be very, very like him.Ken Kesey. Author of a novel (One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x2019;s Nest) which profoundly affected the consciousness of a generation, psychedelic mover and shaker, acid paladin, cosmic iconoclast, hero of yet another book (Tom Wolfe&#x2019;s The Electric Kool-AidAcid Test) which profoundly affected the consciousness of a generation...Okay, let me remind you.In 1962, Kesey - former University of Oregon championship heavyweight wrestler, former graduate student in Wallace Stegner&#x2019;s and Malcolm Cowley&#x2019;s seminars in Stegner&#x2019;s famous Creative Writing Center at Stanford University, and former subject in one of the earliest paid-volunteer, CIA-sponsored research experiments with psychotropic drugs - published his landmark Cuckoo&#x2019;s Nest, the novel that many believe launched the counter- cultural revolution of the Day-Gb Decade. He followed up in 1964 with the epic Sometimes a Great Notion (which, though it drew mixed reviews, is perhaps the greater of the two books), and seemed well on his way to a long career as a novelist.Never trust a Prankster. In the summer of 1964, Ken incorporated himself (Intrepid Trips, Inc.), purchased a 1939 International schoolbus, an Aeroflex camera and other serious moviemaking gear, gathered about him at his La Honda, California, home a group of old and new friends (over the next several years their number would fluctuate from as high as thirty down to half a dozen hardy souls), set them to work preparing the bus for the caper he was planning (the preparations largely consisted of finger-painting its aged yellow fuse lage in an infinite variety of colors), hollered the equivalent of &#x201c;All ashore that&#x2019;s going ashore!&#x201d; (about fifteen people weren&#x2019;t), and struck out for the New York World&#x2019;s Fair, with the intention of making, along the way, a film rather cumbrously entitled Intrepid Traveler and His Merry Band of Pranksters Look for a Kool Place.It turned out to be arguably the longest, strangest trip that&#x2019;s ever been, an odyssey which delivered to an unprepared America its first national contact high, and which, it might be said, resolutely proceeds apace to this very day. The bus - &#x201d;FURTHER,&#x201d; read the manifest - piloted by Beat Generation icon Neal Cassady, meandered across the country outraging local sensibilities at every opportunity and raising consciousness at a prodigious rate, to such an extent that the whole escapade captured the national attention and Kesey&#x2019;s fame as a novelist began to be subsumed by his notoriety as a cultural phenomenon.Two months later, Kesey and the Pranksters were back in La Honda with thirty-six hours of 16-millimeter color film of their adventures, which they intended to edit down to a feature-length movie. They set up a cutting room in a shed in Kesey&#x2019;s yard, and in April 1965, they were still editing away (the Keseys&#x2019; 1964 Christmas tree had been decorated with about half a mile of cut film) when the sheriff of San Mateo County and his merry band of deputies swept down and arrested Kesey and thirteen of the Pranksters for possession of marijuana. All were released on bail the following day, and the charges against twelve of the fourteen were soon dropped; but in December, Kesey and one other Prankster - Page Browning, a longtime friend - were convicted, sentenced to six months in jail and three years of probation, then released on appeal.During the seven-month interim between the arrest and the conviction, Kesey and the Pranksters, along with the then-unknown rock band that became known as the Grateful Dead, had begun to produce a series of psychedelically enhanced Saturday night happenings they called &#x201c;The Acid Test.&#x201d; As word spread, ever-larger crowds turned out for these public events, which were held at various Bay Area venues.On the weekend following Kesey&#x2019;s conviction, the Acid Test was scheduled to be the main attraction of a three-day marathon psychedelic circus called the Trips Festival (the promoters were Kesey, Whole Earth Catalog publisher Stewart Brand, and rock impresario Bill Graham) which would be held in the vast, big-top-like Longshoremen&#x2019;s Hall on Fish erman&#x2019;s Wharf. Many unheralded Bay Area rock groups signed up to perform - among them the Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Charlatans, Big Brother and the Holding Company (with their bluesy, blowzy young singer Janis Joplin), and, of course, the Grateful Dead - and there would also be throbbing-blob light shows, the San Francisco Mime Troupe, a Stewart Brand slide show called &#x201c;America Needs Indians,&#x201d; and, topping the bill, Ken Kesey&#x2019;s Acid Test.Five nights before the Trips Festival was to open, Kesey was arrested again, this time on a San Francisco rooftop in the company of a nineteen-year-old Prankster named Carolyn &#x201c;Mountain Girl&#x201d; Adams. . . and a small quantity of marijuana.Kesey, once again free on bail, did participate in the Trips Festival, which was a huge success. An estimated 12,000 subterranean freaks, heads, Bohos, and retro-Beats crept out of their cribs and digs and pads into the light and found to their amazement that there were 11,999 other freaks, just like themselves, in town. Presto! In the blink of a weekend, a brand-new community discovers itself and instantly becomes a major force in the city&#x2019;s political and cultural life. By defining and energizing it, the Trips Festival may be said to have begat the entire fledgling San Francisco psychedelic rock scene - the Fillmore Audito rium (Bill Graham&#x2019;s principal venue), Winterland, Chet Helms&#x2019;s Family Dog, the Avalon Ballroom, and half a dozen smaller Bay Area hotspots - which in turn spawned Life As We Know It. And Ken Kesey had won a permanent place in the embryonic history of rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll, not in the usual way (though in fact the Pranksters once formed their own rock group and cut an unforgettably dubious LP) but as the inventor of a whole new way to listen.Within a week after the festival, an elderly truck registered to Kesey and containing a pair of fluorescent sneakers (a Kesey trademark) and a suicide note (&#x201c;Ocean, ocean, I&#x2019;ll beat you in the end... &#x201c;) was found parked atop a cliff above the sea along a lonely stretch of the northern California coast. And Ken Kesey, disguised as &#x201c;mild-mannered reporter Steve Lamb,&#x201d; was in sunny Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, knockin&#x2019; back the margaritas.There he remained for almost two months, until he attempted to phone his wife, Faye, in California, and a well-intentioned friend inadvertently mentioned the call in the presence of a real newspaper reporter. &#x201c;Kesey the Corpse Having a Ball!&#x201d; screamed the next day&#x2019;s headlines. Friends frantically wired him that the jig was up, and after hiding out in the Puerto Vallarta jungle for several days he made his way south to Manzanillo, a tropical beach resort rarely visited by gringo tourists. Meanwhile, the Texas novelist Larry McMurtry (Kesey&#x2019;s close friend since their student days at Stanford) had arranged, through a Mexico City attorney, for Kesey to be granted a temporary and somewhat shaky amnesty by the local Colima government. Within weeks a small coterie of Pranksters had arrived, bus and all, followed shortly by Faye and the three Kesey children, &#x2018;They set up shop in a house on the Manzanillo beach and began again to work on the film, which by this time was nearly fifty hours long and seemed to be growing faster than the editing process could manage to shrink it.Kesey remained in Manzanillo for the next six months, an idyll frequently shattered by the sometimes real, sometimes imagined threat of Federales, &#x201c;FBEyes,&#x201d; or vacationing deputies from the San Mateo County sheriff&#x2019;s office. In the fall of 1966, Kesey returned to the States, this time crossing the border on a borrowed horse, carrying a guitar and calling himself &#x201c;Singin&#x2019; Jimmy Anglund.&#x201d; He hid out for nearly two weeks in the homes of Bay Area friends, granted interviews to trusted newspaper and TV reporters, and &#x201c;rubbed salt in J. Edgar Hoover&#x2019;s wounds&#x201d; until half a dozen FBI agents in a carpool chanced to spot him in stop-and-go traffic on the Bayshore Freeway, gave chase, and got their man at last.Kesey was released within a few days, after several of his friends put up their homes to make his bail. He was then tried on the San Francisco charge, and convicted of a misde meanor (&#x201c;knowingly being in a place where marijuana is possessed&#x201d;). In the meantime, his San Mateo County appeal had failed, and on June 23, 1967, he and Page Browning entered the San Mateo County jail and were shortly thereafter transferred to the Sheriff&#x2019;s Honor Camp (a facility located in the coastal redwood country almost literally a stone&#x2019;s throw from Kesey&#x2019;s own La Honda backyard) to serve out their old six-month sentences.Every two or three Sundays during those months, my first wife, Kit, and I would pack up our three kids and a picnic basket and drive up to the Honor Camp to have a picnic lunch with the yardbirds. The first time we went, Kit took Ken a stash of art supplies she&#x2019;d picked out, including a set of Day-Gb pens. And on our second visit, he showed up with the first few pages of this luminous illuminated manuscript (imagine here a monk in his cell...;a cell with bars!) called Cut the Motberfuckers Loose, an illustrated journal of the incarceration he was currently enjoying.It came as no surprise to me that Ken could draw (years before, I&#x2019;d seen a batch of his razor-sharp sketches of the characters in Cuckoo&#x2019;s Nest) or that he had a great pop-aesthetic sense of color and design (the bus itself testified to that). What was astonishing, though, as we saw more and more of these pages on subsequent visits, was that he could sustain such a high level of intensity, page after page after page, each so crammed with words and colors and faces and forms that it seemed ready to explode in your face like a letter bomb. For a jail, the Sheriff&#x2019;s Honor Camp was relatively humane, but as one might suppose, confine ment chafed and galled Ken even more than it would most people, and therefore capital-C Confinement is an almost palpable evil presence in the journal, just as all those words and images and colors seem to be in constant struggle against the edges of the page. The text, with its antic spellings and deliberate crudities and fragments of pin-up porn, is like runic scribblings on the jailhouse wall: cramped, volatile, funny, and as conspiratorial as a jail break.After his release, Ken beat a strategic retreat to Oregon, and he and Faye set up house keeping in an old dairy barn on a small farm near Springfield, where Faye still lives today. In late 1967, a few pages of Kesey&#x2019;s jail journals appeared in Ramparts magazine, reduced to the size of playing cards, in &#x201c;color&#x201d; but, compared to the originals, looking as muddy and murky as if they&#x2019;d been dipped in bongwater.Up in Oregon, Ken spent the next several months working on the jail journal, with an eye to publishing it in book form, until it became apparent that print technology as it existed at that time simply wasn&#x2019;t capable of doing justice to this oversized, illustrated work. He reluctantly abandoned the project, and the finished pages eventually landed in the Special Collections room of the University of Oregon, which has extensive holdings of Ken&#x2019;s papers. Meanwhile, the bus trip film was proving stubbornly resistant to all attempts to cut it down to size, and it too was eventually shelved.In the mid-1990s, modern technology came to the rescue of the 1964 movie when the new, computerized Avid editing machine made it possible at last to transfer all that old film footage to videotape, edit it, and synchronize the sound. Kesey, his longtime friend and cohort Ken Babbs, and a couple of techno-savvy second-generation Pranksters completed two hour-long videos (a third is in the works) and made them available on the Prankster website (www.intrepidtrips.com).During the thirty-odd years after his return to Oregon, Kesey had published many books - autobiographical essays, cultural commentary, children&#x2019;s books, a wonderful grab-bag miscellany called Garage Sale, even another novel or two, as well as six issues of an extraordinary little magazine, Spit in the Ocean. But the fabled jail book languished in an archival box on a shelf in the library until, mirabile dictu, it happened again: new tech nology rode to the rescue and made possible the remarkable volume you now hold before you.But way back in 1990 there had transpired the first of these miraculous resuscitations, this time of Further itself. Actually, the original Further - the Ur-Further, I like to call it - was long since beyond saving, so Ken had retired it to the swamp behind the barn. He bought himself a ringer, a compact &#x2018;49 International bus in good running order, and turned it into the sweetest little article of psychedelic rolling stock that ever toddled down the pike.Fittingly, when Ken died eleven years later, the renascent Further bore him in grand style to his grave.</p><h2>Blues Brothers: Private</h2><p>Sister Stigmata, the loving nun who raised the Blues Brothers from their first days at the St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud orphanage recounts the highlights of their pre-celebrity life and the rise of the notorious duo</p><p></p><h2>The Serpent&#39;s Tongue: Prose, Poetry, and Art of the New Mexican Pueblos</h2><p>A colorful anthology captures the Pueblo culture through an array of stories, poems, and paintings depicting the Pueblo way of life as well as their celebrations, beliefs, symbols, and more.</p><p>Award-winning writer and journalist Nancy Wood first became involved with the Pueblo people in 1962.

What Hyemeyohsts Storm did for the Plains Indians in his Seven Arrows (Ballantine, 1985), Wood has done for the New Mexico Pueblos. This accomplished and wide-ranging anthology brings together primary-source accounts, poetry, legends, recipes, reminiscences, and beautifully reproduced art and photographs to chronicle the tribes' history. Divided into eight sections, the handsome, oversized volume covers creation myths, childhood, the given truths of the tribes, spiritual beliefs, the actual pueblos, hunting, ceremonies and courtship, and the meeting of the Pueblo with outside worlds. The writings have been meticulously chosen from an array of Native and non-Indian sources including those of prominent anthropologists. N. Scott Momaday, Willa Cather, Barry Lopez, D. H. Lawrence, Edward S. Curtis, and Tony Hillerman are a few of the better-known names that appear. Add to this mix a stunning array of artwork that includes photogravures, paintings, archival reproductions, drawings, and sculpture, and the result is a clear revelation of the world of New Mexican Native Americans. Students of all ages will find the book interesting browsing material, if only for the art. However, it will prove most useful for librarians, teachers, and storytellers who need information or legends from this particular culture. The retold myths especially lend themselves well to oral presentation.

Human mistress of the great god Apollo, the Oracle had the power to enter into ecstatic union with him and bring back his prophecies and counsel for all who came seeking answers. Residing in Apollo&#39;s temple on the sacred slopes of Mount Parnassus in central Greece, the Oracle was consulted on matters large and small. Though the air of magic that surrounds her might cast her as a legend like the cyclops or the mythical Cassandra, the Oracle did in fact exsist and her visions caused her to become the single most influential figure in all of ancient Greece.</p><p>William J. Broad is a senior writer at <i>The New York Times</i> and with colleagues there has twice won the Pulitzer Prize as well as an Emmy. For three decades, he has covered topics ranging from biology and geology to astronomy and nuclear arms. He is the author or coauthor of six books, most recently <i>Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War</i>, a number-one <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. His books have been translated into more than a dozen languages and his work featured in <i>The Best American Science Writing 2005</i>. He holds a master's degree in the history of science from the University of Wisconsin and lives with his wife and three children in Larchmont, New York.The oracle at Delphi influenced politicians and slaves with her prophecies, yet her life and practices are shrouded in mystery. In a fascinating story that is part detective tale and part science report, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>New York Times</i> writer Broad unveils the oracle. In order to prepare for her encounter with Apollo, the oracle descended into a chasm near the temple, where she would breathe the holy pneuma. She would then deliver her prophecies in a trance, sometimes foaming at the mouth and sometimes in a frenzy. When the temple was unearthed in the 19th century, archeologists and geologists searched for the mysterious chasm. Broad traces the history of these efforts and the conflicts they produced. By the mid&#x2013;20th century, many scientists argued that the chasm never existed. He follows two modern-day Indiana Joneses, geologist Jelle de Boer and archeologist John Hale, as they refute those conclusions by uncovering the chasm and the geological faults that produced hallucinogenic vapors. Broad's lively prose and fast-paced storytelling conduct us on a breathless adventure of religious mystery and scientific discovery&#x2014;and ends with a surprising consideration of the meaning of the oracle's powers and the existence of "shadowy worlds... beyond the ken" of science.

Children&#39;s BOMC Main. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>Baby bat Stellaluna's life is flitting along right on schedule--until an owl attacks her mother one night, knocking the bewildered batlet out of her mother's loving grasp. The tiny bat is lucky enough to land in a nest of baby birds, but her whole world has just turned upside down. Literally. Stellaluna's adoptive bird mom accepts her into her nest, but only on the condition that Stellaluna will act like a bird, not a bat. Soon Stellaluna has learned to behave like a good bird should--she quits hanging by her feet and starts eating bugs. But when she finally has an opportunity to show her bird siblings what life as a bat is like, all of them are confounded. "How can we be so different and feel so much alike?" one asks. "And how can we feel so different and be so much alike?" asks another. "I agree," Stellaluna responds. "But we're friends. And that's a fact." Anyone who has ever been asked to be someone they're not will understand the conflicts--and possibilities--Stellaluna faces. This gorgeously illustrated book is sure to be an all-time favorite with readers, whether they've left the nest or not. (Click to see a sample spread.

Such is certainly the case with Philip Pullman's heroic, at times heart-wrenching novel, <i>The Golden Compass</i>, a story ostensibly for children but one perhaps even better appreciated by adults. The protagonist of this complex fantasy is young Lyra Belacqua, a precocious orphan growing up within the precincts of Oxford University. But it quickly becomes clear that Lyra's Oxford is not precisely like our own--nor is her world. For one thing, people there each have a personal <i>d�mon</i>, the manifestation of their soul in animal form. For another, hers is a universe in which science, theology, and magic are closely allied: <blockquote> As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins. She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really. Probably the stars had d�mons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them. </blockquote> Not that Lyra spends much time worrying about it; what she likes best is "clambering over the College roofs with Roger the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war." But Lyra's carefree existence changes forever when she and her d�mon, Pantalaimon, first prevent an assassination attempt against her uncle, the powerful Lord Asriel, and then overhear a secret discussion about a mysterious entity known as Dust. Soon she and Pan are swept up in a dangerous game involving disappearing children, a beautiful woman with a golden monkey d�mon, a trip to the far north, and a set of allies ranging from "gyptians" to witches to an armor-clad polar bear. <p> In <i>The Golden Compass</i>, Philip Pullman has written a masterpiece that transcends genre. It is a children's book that will appeal to adults, a fantasy novel that will charm even the most hardened realist. Best of all, the author doesn't speak down to his audience, nor does he pull his punches; there is genuine terror in this book, and heartbreak, betrayal, and loss. There is also love, loyalty, and an abiding morality that infuses the story but never overwhelms it. This is one of those rare novels that one wishes would never end. Fortunately, its sequel, <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, will help put off that inevitability for a while longer. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman<br>I love this book, so when we decided to give out copies at a convention this summer, I was thrilled!

Never once did I regret my decision to enter nursing."</i>---<b>From the Foreword by Harriet Schulman Forman, RN, EdD</b></p><h2>The Atlas</h2><p>An unconventional work offers fifty-three interconnected tales, fables, and portraits, ranging from the journalistic to the surreal, that bring to life a wide and strange array of characters in diverse settings, from Sarajevo to Jerusalem to New York.</p><p>William T. Vollmann is the author of ten novels, including <i>Europe Central</i>, which won the National Book Award.&nbsp; He has also written four collections of stories, including <i>The</i> <i>Atlas</i>, which won the PEN Center USA West Award for Fiction, a memoir, and six works of nonfiction, including <i>Rising Up and Rising Down</i> and <i>Imperial</i>, both of which were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award. He is the recipient of a Whiting Writers Award and the Strauss Living Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.&nbsp; His journalism and fiction have been published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Harpers</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Granta</i>, and many other publications.Making a bid for the bleakest book of the year, Vollmann (Butterfly Stories, 1993, etc.) fashions a world-wide web of despair in a palindrome of 53 stories, each having to do with sorrow or loss, and often involving the hopeless lives of whores from Cambodia to Canada. From the jungle to the tundra, from the smog of L.A. to the fog of Hong Kong, from bullfights in Mexico City to firefights in Sarajevo, these stories, often drawing on Vollmann's own travels and life, mingle autobiography and invention, creating a provocative, sometimes dizzying, hybrid. Among the most resonant pieces are the unsparing description of childhood loss of a sister, and a tale set in Bosnia, involving an incident when a friend was shot dead in a car in which the author was also riding. Loves lost also figure prominently: the tender prostitute Vollmann met during his first trip to Phnom Penh; a lame Ojibway in Winnepeg, whose husband took him on a drunk; his first girlfriend, now married with children and locked in a battle with breast cancer. Diverse adventures, which also have a way of distancing the writer from his world, mingle with the sexual ones. He pays to go on a walrus hunt with an old Inuit and his grandsons and is mostly ignored, cuts short a night of ringside kickboxing in Bangkok when the sport's brutality overwhelms him, and is tolerated by urban aborigines in Sydney only as long as the beer he's bought holds out. Despite their distanced quality, these fantasies and terrifying visions of underclass reality at every latitude and longitude are poetically, damningly precise. As in other recent work from Vollmann, however, repetitive images seem to reiterate rather than advance the theme, turning terrific writing into tedium. One weeps somewhat reflexively for the lost souls mirrored in these fragments; more heartfelt, unfortunately, is a horror at the squandering of such a prodigious prose talent.

Not accepting defeat easily, Wolfert created a new brain-centric diet, emphasizing healthy meats and fresh vegetables, and her recipes are included here. <br><i>Unforgettable</i> is a delight for those who know and love Paula Wolfert's recipes, but will be a delicious discovery for those who love food, but have not yet heard of this influential cookbook writer and culinary legend.</p><p><b>Emily Kaiser Thelin</b> is a writer, editor, and former restaurant cook.

With unprecedented candor, Yanni describes his long struggle to separate himself from the &#39;New Age&#39; label, his ongoing battles with a music industry bewildered by his work, and the depression that threatened to derail his career. With great affection, he also discusses his long relationship with Linda Evans and shares the lessons about love and truth that he&#39;s learned from his father along the way.</p><p>Yanni was born in 1954, in Kalamata, Greece. He moved the U.S. and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1976 with a major in psychology. He taught himself music, and has become one of the world&#39;s best-loved musician/composers, with global sales of over 20 million albums, and more than 35 Gold and Platinum album awards. He lives in Florida.The platinum-selling electronic-don't call him New Age-instrumentalist Yanni tends to inspire strong opinions, and this ambitious autobiography, which Yanni calls "a book about a life of challenges, lessons, dreams, and obstacles," is unlikely to change any of them. Yanni, with the help of Rensin (who similarly aided Tim Allen and Chris Rock with their memoirs), adopts a conversational, occasionally almost condescending tone, full of tics like "Mind you" and "Can you imagine?". He recounts his "idyllic" childhood in a Greek village; his high school years as a champion swimmer; his time in rock bands (complete with groupies and cocaine); his nine-year love affair with Linda Evans; his near-breakdown; and his determination to make and market his music. Throughout, his plainspokenness is jarringly juxtaposed with show-offy references to the likes of Socrates and Schopenhauer. His claims that anyone could match his success if only he or she tried hard enough, perhaps meant to be inspirational, come off instead as preachy. In his acknowledgments, Yanni writes that "words have never been my medium"; fortunately, his fans love him for his music. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Armor Battles of the Waffen SS, 1943-45 (Stackpole Military History Series)</h2><p>The Waffen SS were considered the elite of the German armed forces in the Second World War and were involved in almost continuous combat.

A seminal work: an often misinterpreted work: and an indipensable source of administrative theory." &#x2015;Arch T. Dodson, Cornell University</strong></p> This brief essay by the founder of scientific management has served for nearly a century as a primer for administrators and for students of managerial techniques. Although scientific management was developed primarily as a system for increasing productivity in industry, its principles have been applied to all kinds of large-scale enterprises, including operations with departments and agencies of the federal government. It is in this volume that Frederick Winslow Taylor gave the theory of scientific management its clearest airing.<br><br> Born in 1856, Taylor began work at age eighteen as an apprentice to a pattern-maker and as a machinist. A few years later he joined the Midvale Steel Company as a laborer, and in eight years rose to chief engineer. During this time he developed and tested what he called the "task system," which became known as the Taylor System and eventually as scientific management. He made careful experiments to determine the best way of performing each operation and the amount of time it required, analyzing the materials, tools, and work sequence, and establishing a clear division of labor between management and workers. His experiments laid the groundwork for the principles that are expounded in this essay, which was first published in 1911.</p><p><p>For more than 80 years, this influential work by Frederick Winslow Taylor&#x2014;the pioneer of scientific management studies&#x2014;has inspired administrators and students of managerial techniques to adopt productivity-increasing procedures. Indeed, this book laid the groundwork for modern organization and decision theory.<br>As an engineer for a steel company, Taylor made careful experiments to determine the best way of performing each operation and the amount of time it required, analyzing the materials, tools, and work sequence, and establishing a clear division of labor between management and workers. His experiments resulted in the formulation of the principles expounded in this remarkable essay, first published in 1911.<br>Taylor advocated a scientific management system that develops leaders by organizing workers for efficient cooperation, rather than curtailing inefficiency by searching for exceptional leaders someone else has trained. The whole system rests upon a foundation of clearly defined laws and rules. Moreover, the fundamental principles of scientific management apply to all kinds of human activities, from the simplest individual acts to the most elaborate cooperative efforts of mighty corporations. Correct application of these principles, according to Taylor, will yield truly astonishing results.<br>Unabridged Dover (1998) republication of the work published by Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, New York, 1911.</p><p></p>Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856&#x2013;1915), widely known as F.

Taylor was one of the intellectual leaders of the Efficiency Movement and his ideas, broadly conceived, were highly influential in the Progressive Era.</p><h2>Halloween and Satanism</h2><p>This book traces the origins of Halloween and gives the true meaning behind this celebration of &#39;fun and games.&#39; The material in this book is explicit.</p><p></p><h2>The Man Who Shocked The World: The Life And Legacy Of Stanley Milgram</h2><p>The creator of the famous &#34;Obedience Experiments,&#34; carried out at Yale in the 1960s, and originator of the &#34;six degrees of separation&#34; concept, Stanley Milgram was one of the most innovative scientists of our time. In this sparkling biography-the first in-depth portrait of Milgram-Thomas Blass captures the colorful personality and pioneering work of a social psychologist who profoundly altered the way we think about human nature.Born in the Bronx in 1933, Stanley Milgram was the son of Eastern European Jews, and his powerful Obedience Experiments had obvious intellectual roots in the Holocaust. The experiments, which confirmed that &#34;normal&#34; people would readily inflict pain on innocent victims at the behest of an authority figure, generated a firestorm of public interest and outrage-proving, as they did, that moral beliefs were far more malleable than previously thought. But Milgram also explored other aspects of social psychology, from information overload to television violence to the notion that we live in a small world. Although he died suddenly at the height of his career, his work continues to shape the way we live and think today. Blass offers a brilliant portrait of an eccentric visionary scientist who revealed the hidden workings of our very social world.</p><p><b>Thomas Blass, Ph.D.</b>, a professor of social psychology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, is the undisputed expert on Milgram's life and work. He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.Questioning Authority<p> </p><p>Nearly half a century after they were first conducted, psychologist Stanley Milgram's obedience experiments still rank among the most important studies ever conducted in social psychology. In 1961 as a young professor at Yale, Milgram demonstrated that ordinary people would willingly inflict what they believed were increasingly painful electric shocks on strangers if ordered to do so by someone in a position of authority. Because they occurred and were widely publicized around the time of the trial of Adolph Eichmann, the implementer of the Nazis' Final Solution who insisted he was merely following orders, Milgram's groundbreaking experiments received worldwide attention.</p><p> The studies were controversial and remain so, largely because they involved deception (the shocks were fake, and the subjects who received them were actors). But they continue to resonate today because of how strikingly they illustrate individuals' willingness to subjugate their own judgment to that of authority figures. </p><p> As University of Maryland psychology professor Thomas Blass makes clear in his highly readable biography The Man Who Shocked the World (Basic, $26), Milgram's far-reaching influence in the world of psychology extends beyond the obedience experiments. It was Milgram, a creative, mercurial, dynamic rebel of protean talents -- he also made films and was involved in television production -- who originated the concept of "six degrees of separation." Before his death in 1984 of a heart attack at age 51, he also advanced the notion of the "familiar stranger" in urban life -- a person recognized because of repeated sightings, say, on the subway, but with whom one never actually interacts.</p><p>While Blass's book is not very enlightening on what made Milgram tick, his lucid discussion of the scientist's most important and controversial work and its implications is trenchant and provocative.</p><p> </p><p>A Shot Under Suspicion</p><p> </p><p>In a 1796 experiment that would break today's ethical rules, British physician Edward Jenner inoculated an unsuspecting 8-year-old boy with cowpox extracted from a milkmaid's sores. Once the boy recovered from this mild infection, Jenner exposed him to smallpox, correctly surmising that he would be protected by his previous exposure.</p><p>Vaccine -- from vacca, the Latin word for cow -- is the name Jenner gave to his new discovery. Today, vaccines protect against a spectrum of diseases that once claimed millions of lives. Ongoing research fuels the hope that they will one day prevent HIV, Ebola virus and other deadly infections. But like all medical interventions, vaccines are not without risk. In 1986, Congress passed the National Childhood Injury Protection Act to protect vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits.</p><p>In The Virus and the Vaccine: The True Story of a Cancer-Causing Monkey Virus, Contaminated Polio Vaccine, and the Millions of Americans Exposed (St. Martin's, $25.95), science writers Debbie Bookchin and Jim Schumacher contend that public health officials ignored suspicions that the polio vaccines, especially the live vaccine developed by Jonas Salk, were contaminated with a cancer-causing virus now known as SV40. Between 1954 and 1963, an estimated 100 millions Americans were inoculated with this vaccine. </p><p>In sometimes breathless prose, the authors outline a scientific conspiracy and coverup. They find scientists and public health officials "firmly entrenched in the dogma about SV40" and unwilling to consider the possibility that the contaminated vaccine could be responsible for some existing cancer cases and a ticking time bomb for more. </p><p>Yet science is rarely so simple, and scientists are not often so neatly divided. While SV40 is linked to development of some tumors (as are several other viruses), much remains to be unraveled about its exact role and whether human exposure to the virus occurs largely from polio vaccine. At a 2002 meeting on SV40 convened by the National Academy of Sciences, researchers reported that multiple epidemiological studies have failed to link use of the vaccines and increased rates of cancer. The role of SV40 is still being determined.</p><p>No doubt the development of the polio vaccines and SV40 is a story worth telling. But what The Virus and the Vaccine illustrates best is the rapid advancement of scientific knowledge and the need for scientists -- as well as science writers -- to keep open minds and to stay focused on the evidence at hand. </p><p>Impure Science</p><p></p><p>For all the purity and high-mindedness scientists claim for themselves and their work, they inhabit a realm no less subject to human folly and vicious competition than any other part of society. And in science, as elsewhere, the losers tend to be those less equipped to play the game.</p><p>In The Mold in Dr. Florey's Coat: The Story of the Penicillin Miracle (Henry Holt, $25), journalist and biographer Eric Lax explores the human drama behind the discovery and development of antibiotics, an achievement that brought to fruition the efforts of Edward Jenner, Joseph Lister and Louis Pasteur to understand and combat microbial disease. The commonly accepted story of the development of penicillin during World War II -- done on the cheap in British laboratories in the face of the Nazi onslaught -- is fascinating enough. In the hands of Lax, best known for his bestselling biography of Woody Allen, the story behind the story is nearly as dramatic.</p><p>The title character in Lax's tale is Howard Florey, who along with fellow Oxford researcher Ernst Chain shared a Nobel Prize with Alexander Fleming for the development of penicillin. That Fleming today is regarded as the discoverer of penicillin while Florey, Chain and their colleagues are barely known is not completely unjust: Lax likens him to a man who saw something shiny in the water at Sutter's Mill, was certain it was gold, but couldn't figure out how to mine and refine it. It was the Oxford researchers, Lax says, whose painstaking efforts resulted in methods for using the wonder drug to treat patients. (The book's title refers to their idea for preserving their research in case of Nazi attack: Florey and the others smeared bits of Penicillium notatum onto their clothes, where the mold could remain dormant and fleeing scientists could carry samples to safe havens.)</p><p>Lax attributes Fleming's lasting fame to a variety of factors, from competition for research funding to British bias (Fleming was a Scotsman, while Florey was Australian and Chain a German Jewish immigrant). But more than anything else, he sees Florey and Chain as having gotten so little credit because they labored under the quaint belief that science should be advanced purely for the sake of society rather than for fame and fortune. </p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Courtship Conversations </b><br>Eight ideas for great dates that will help grow and guide your relationship. <br><br><b>Story Behind the Book</b><br><br>&#x201c;I wrote I Kissed Dating Goodbye to challenge singles to drop the worldly approach to serial dating and reconsider the way they pursued romance in light of God&#x2019;s Word. Since then, I&#x2019;ve received letters asking questions like, So, what comes between friendship and marriage? and, How can you know when you are ready for marriage? Boy Meets Girl answers those questions. Now as a happily married man I can look back on my courtship with Shannon and see from personal experience that God is faithful. If you trust Him enough to wait on romance in dating, He will lovingly guide you as you pursue it in courtship...right to that wonderful moment when you kneel together at the altar.&#x201d; &#x2014; Joshua Harris</p><p>Joshua Harris follows up his bestselling <i>I Kissed Dating Goodbye</i> with <i>Boy Meets Girl</i>, the story of how he met and married his wife, Shannon. Where Harris's first book encouraged readers to throw off modern ideas of romantic fixation, <i>Boy Meets Girl</i> goes to the next level and urges single Christian men and women to pursue courtship, and ultimately marriage, thoughtfully and prayerfully. Knowing that many readers will balk at the idea of premeditated courtship, Harris insists that dating should not be emotional recreation but rather a careful decision rooted in obedience to God. While the anecdotes used to reveal true-to-life scenarios about dating pitfalls are somewhat elementary (and geared to those in their 20s), Harris succeeds in hammering home the point that obedience to God's word, selfless love, community, purity, and satisfaction in God are the most important aspect of any relationship. The last section of the book is particularly practical, discussing forgiveness of past sexual sin, questions to ask before tying the knot, and how an understanding of our sinful nature can lead to conflict resolution. For Harris's mere twentysomething years of life experience, his maturity and devotion to God are sincere evidence that he has indeed practiced what he has preached, resulting in a passionate relationship with the love of his life. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>Joshua Harris lives outside Washington , D.C. , in Gaithersburg , Maryland , where he is senior pastor at Covenant Life Church .

With twin daughters finishing high school, a son at Dartmouth, and a kindergartner from her second marriage, there seems to be no challenge to which Olympia cannot rise. Until one sunny day in May, when she opens an invitation for her daughters to attend the most exclusive coming-out ball in New York&#x2013;and chaos erupts all around her. One twin&#x2019;s excitement is balanced by the other&#x2019;s outrage; her previous husband&#x2019;s profound snobbism is in sharp contrast to her current husband&#x2019;s flat refusal to attend.<br> <br> For Olympia&#x2019;s husband, Harry, whose parents survived the Holocaust, the idea of a blue-blood debutante ball is abhorrent. Her daughter Veronica, a natural-born rebel, agrees&#x2013; while Veronica&#x2019;s identical twin, Virginia, is already shopping for the perfect dress. Then there&#x2019;s Olympia&#x2019;s ex, an insufferable snob, who sees the ball as the perfect opportunity for a family feud. And amid all the hubbub, Olympia&#x2019;s college-age son, Charlie, is facing a turning point in his life&#x2013;and may need his mother more than ever. But despite it all, Olympia is determined to steer her family through the event until, just days before the cotillion, things begin to unravel with alarming speed.<br> <br> From a son&#x2019;s crisis to a daughter&#x2019;s heartbreak, from a case of the chicken pox to a political debate raging in her household, Olympia is on the verge of surrender. And that is when, in a series of startling choices and changes of heart, family, friends, and even a blue-haired teenager all find a way to turn a night of calamity into an evening of magic. As old wounds are healed, barriers are shattered and new traditions are born, and a debutante ball becomes a catalyst for change, revelation, acceptance, and love.<br> <br> In a novel that is by turns profound, poignant, moving, and warmly funny, Danielle Steel tells the story of an extraordinary family&#x2013;finding new ways of letting go, stepping up, and coming out...in the ways that matter most.</p><p>Danielle Steel has been hailed as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors, with over 570 million copies of her novels sold. Her many international bestsellers include <b>Rogue, Honor Thyself, Amazing Grace, Bungalow 2, Sisters, H.R.H.,</b><i> </i>and other highly acclaimed novels. She is also the author of <b>His Bright Light,</b> the story of her son Nick Traina&#x2019;s life and death.<i>Chapter One<br> <br> </i><br> Olympia Crawford Rubinstein was whizzing around her kitchen on a sunny May morning, in the brownstone she shared with her family on Jane Street in New York, near the old meat-packing district of the West Village. It had long since become a fashionable neighborhood of mostly modern apartment buildings with doormen, and old renovated brownstones. Olympia was fixing lunch for her five-year-old son, Max. The school bus was due to drop him off in a few minutes. He was in kindergarten at Dalton, and Friday was a half day for him. She always took Fridays off to spend them with him. Although Olympia had three older children from her first marriage, Max was Olympia and Harry's only child.<br> <br> Olympia and Harry had restored the house six years before, when she was pregnant with Max. Before that, they had lived in her Park Avenue apartment, which she had previously shared with her three children after her divorce. And then Harry joined them. She had met Harry Rubinstein a year after her divorce. And now, she and Harry had been married for thirteen years. They had waited eight years to have Max, and his parents and siblings adored him. He was a loving, funny, happy child.<br> Olympia was a partner in a booming law practice, specializing in civil rights issues and class action lawsuits. Her favorite cases, and what she specialized in, were those that involved discrimination against or some form of abuse of children. She had made a name for herself in her field. She had gone to law school after her divorce, fifteen years before, and married Harry two years later. He had been one of her law professors at Columbia Law School, and was now a judge on the federal court of appeals. He had recently been considered for a seat on the Supreme Court. In the end, they hadn't appointed him, but he'd come close, and she and Harry both hoped that the next time a vacancy came up, he would get it.<br> <br> She and Harry shared all the same beliefs, values, and passions--even though they came from very different backgrounds. He came from an Orthodox Jewish home, and both his parents had been Holocaust survivors as children. His mother had gone to Dachau from Munich at ten, and lost her entire family. His father had been one of the few survivors of Auschwitz, and they met in Israel later. They had married as teenagers, moved to London, and from there to the States. Both had lost their entire families, and their only son had become the focus of all their energies, dreams, and hopes. They had worked like slaves all their lives to give him an education, his father as a tailor and his mother as a seamstress, working in the sweatshops of the Lower East Side, and eventually on Seventh Avenue in what was later referred to as the garment district. His father had died just after Harry and Olympia married. Harry's greatest regret was that his father hadn't known Max. Harry's mother, Frieda, was a strong, intelligent, loving woman of seventy-six, who thought her son was a genius, and her grandson a prodigy.<br> <br> Olympia had converted from her staunch Episcopalian background to Judaism when she married Harry. They attended a Reform synagogue, and Olympia said the prayers for Shabbat every Friday night, and lit the candles, which never failed to touch Harry. There was no doubt in Harry's mind, or even his mother's, that Olympia was a fantastic woman, a great mother to all her children, a terrific attorney, and a wonderful wife. Like Olympia, Harry had been married before, but he had no other children. Olympia was turning forty-five in July, and Harry was fifty-three. They were well matched in all ways, though their backgrounds couldn't have been more different. Even physically, they were an interesting and complementary combination. Her hair was blond, her eyes were blue, he was dark, with dark brown eyes, she was tiny, he was a huge teddy bear of a man, with a quick smile and an easygoing disposition. Olympia was shy and serious, though prone to easy laughter, especially when it was provoked by Harry or her children. She was a remarkably dutiful and loving daughter-in-law to Harry's mother, Frieda.<br> <br> Olympia's background was entirely different from Harry's. The Crawfords were an illustrious and extremely social New York family, whose blue-blooded ancestors had intermarried with Astors and Vanderbilts for generations. Buildings and academic institutions were named after them, and theirs had been one of the largest "cottages" in Newport, Rhode Island, where they spent the summers. The family fortune had dwindled to next to nothing by the time her parents died when she was in college, and she had been forced to sell the "cottage" and surrounding estate to pay their debts and taxes. Her father had never really worked, and as one of her distant relatives had said after he died, "he had a small fortune, he had made it from a large one." By the time she cleaned up all their debts and sold their property, there was simply no money, just rivers of blue blood and aristocratic connections. She had just enough left to pay for her education, and put a small nest egg away, which later paid for law school.<br> <br> She married her college sweetheart, Chauncey Bedham Walker IV, six months after she graduated from Vassar, and he from Princeton. He had been charming, handsome, and fun-loving, the captain of the crew team, an expert horseman, played polo, and when they met, Olympia was understandably dazzled by him. Olympia was head over heels in love with him, and didn't give a damn about his family's enormous fortune. She was totally in love with Chauncey, enough so as not to notice that he drank too much, played constantly, had a roving eye, and spent far too much money. He went to work in his family's investment bank, and did anything he wanted, which eventually included going to work as seldom as possible, spending literally no time with her, and having random affairs with a multitude of women. By the time she knew what was happening, she and Chauncey had three children. Charlie came along two years after they were married, and his identical twin sisters, Virginia and Veronica, three years later. When she and Chauncey split up seven years after they married, Charlie was five, the twins two, and Olympia was twenty-nine years old. As soon as they separated, he quit his job at the bank, and went to live in Newport with his grandmother, the doyenne of Newport and Palm Beach society, and devoted himself to playing polo and chasing women.<br> <br> A year later Chauncey married Felicia Weatherton, who was the perfect mate for him. They built a house on his grandmother's estate, which he ultimately inherited, filled her stables with new horses, and had three daughters in four years. A year after Chauncey married Felicia, Olympia married Harry Rubinstein, which Chauncey found not only ridiculous but appalling. He was rendered speechless when their son, Charlie, told him his mother had converted to the Jewish faith. He had been equally shocked earlier when Olympia enrolled in law school, all of which proved to him, as Olympia had figured out long before, that despite the similarity of their ancestry, she and Chauncey had absolutely nothing in common, and never would. As she grew older, the ideas that had seemed normal to her in her youth appalled her. Almost all of Chauncey's values, or lack of them, were anathema to her.<br> <br> The fifteen years since their divorce had been years of erratic truce, and occasional minor warfare, usually over money. He supported their three children decently, though not generously. Despite what he had inherited from his family, Chauncey was stingy with his first family, and far more generous with his second wife and their children. To add insult to injury, he had forced Olympia to agree that she would never urge their children to become Jewish. It wasn't an issue anyway. She had no intention of doing so. Olympia's conversion was a private, personal decision between her and Harry. Chauncey was unabashedly anti-Semitic. Harry thought Olympia's first husband was pompous, arrogant, and useless. Other than the fact that he was her children's father and she had loved him when she married him, for the past fifteen years, Olympia found it impossible to defend him. Prejudice was Chauncey's middle name. There was absolutely nothing politically correct about him or Felicia, and Harry loathed him. They represented everything he detested, and he could never understand how Olympia had tolerated him for ten minutes, let alone seven years of marriage. People like Chauncey and Felicia, and the whole hierarchy of Newport society, and all it stood for, were a mystery to Harry. He wanted to know nothing about it, and Olympia's occasional explanations were wasted on him.<br> <br> Harry adored Olympia, her three children, and their son, Max. And in some ways, her daughter Veronica seemed more like Harry's daughter than Chauncey's. They shared all of the same extremely liberal, socially responsible ideas. Virginia, her twin, was much more of a throwback to their Newport ancestry, and was far more frivolous than her twin sister. Charlie, their older brother, was at Dartmouth, studying theology and threatening to become a minister. Max was a being unto himself, a wise old soul, who his grandmother swore was just like her own father, who had been a rabbi in Germany before being sent to Dachau, where he had helped as many people as he could before he was exterminated along with the rest of her family.<br> <br> The stories of Frieda's childhood and lost loved ones always made Olympia weep. Frieda Rubinstein had a number tattooed on the inside of her left wrist, which was a sobering reminder of the childhood the Nazis had stolen from her. Because of it, she had worn long sleeves all her life, and still did. Olympia frequently bought beautiful silk blouses and long-sleeved sweaters for her. There was a powerful bond of love and respect between the two women, which continued to deepen over the years.<br> <br> Olympia heard the mail being pushed ...</p><h2>Hot Beignets &amp; Warm Boudoirs</h2><p>Aah, romance...synonymous with the South and especially Louisiana, Chef Folse&#x2019;s sixth cookbook introduces readers to another romantic element of our state&#x2014;the bed and breakfast homes.

He was in a small room, dimly lit by a very large digital clock, which glowed red, making the room pink. The time read 9:46.<br><br>He lifted his head from the foam rubber pillow and looked about. Walls, ceiling, steel table with two chairs, steel shutter lowered over the only window. His bladder was near bursting, and he got out of bed and wobbled over to a closed door, behind it a small bathroom. He relieved himself noisily, then turned to his left to examine himself in the small mirror over the sink. Too dark. He groped for the light switch and found it, wincing in the bright light. He could only have described the image in the mirror as haggard. He splashed cold water on his face, then looked again: just the same. On the counter next to the sink were a plastic-wrapped toothbrush, a tiny tube of toothpaste, a tiny can of shaving cream, and a disposable razor. He tried the toothbrush first, and scrubbed away the fur that coated his teeth.<br><br>The beard was hard to deal with, and he wished for electric clippers. Still, he got it scraped off, cutting himself only twice. He tried the shower next, and it worked well. He used the tiny bottle of shampoo on the soap dish next to the tiny bar of soap. He used the only towel to dry himself and noticed a flesh-colored bandage on the inside of his left elbow. He ripped it off and found two tiny wounds in the vein. Then he toweled his hair dry and brushed it back with his fingers. He got into the cheap terry robe hanging on the bathroom door, noticing that the bedroom or cell, as it might be, was now lit by weak sunlight, and a dry cleaner&#x2019;s plastic sleeve and a shopping bag now hung on a hook on the door. He thought he smelled food somewhere, and his stomach growled.<br><br>He walked over to the door and noticed a button on the wall next to it, with a plastic sign reading &#x201c;Ring for attendant.&#x201d;<br><br>Attendant? Had he been involuntarily admitted to a mental hospital? He aimed a finger at the button, but a voice stopped him.<br><br>&#x201c;That won&#x2019;t be necessary,&#x201d; a man said.<br><br>Stone wheeled around and found a young man dressed in green hospital scrubs seated at the table, two plastic trays heaped with eggs and bacon before him.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you like some breakfast, Mr. Barrington?&#x201d; the man asked, indicating the other chair.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, yes,&#x201d; Stone said, taking a seat and attacking the food, which was still fairly warm. He washed eggs down with orange juice made from concentrate. &#x201c;At the risk of employing a clich�,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;where am I?&#x201d;<br><br>The man took a mouthful of eggs, chewed for a moment and swallowed, washing it down with coffee from a foam cup. &#x201c;Where do you think you are?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;This appears to be a hospital room, and you appear to be a doctor,&#x201d; Stone said, peering at the plastic name tag pinned to the man&#x2019;s scrubs. &#x201c;Dr. Keeler.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only your second guess was good,&#x201d; Keeler said, &#x201c;and you cheated.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Funny farm? Addiction treatment center?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you insane or an addict?&#x201d; the doctor asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Neither. I thought perhaps you thought I was one or the other, maybe both. Somebody seems to have injected me with something in my left arm.&#x201d; He took a sip of the awful orange juice.<br><br>&#x201c;You are in the American Embassy, in Paris,&#x201d; the doctor replied.<br><br>Stone choked on his orange juice.<br><br>&#x201c;France, not Texas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you for making the distinction,&#x201d; Stone said, coughing.<br><br>&#x201c;How do you feel?&#x201d; the doctor asked when Stone had recovered normal breathing.<br><br>&#x201c;Fuzzy around the edges,&#x201d; Stone replied.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not surprised. What&#x2019;s the last thing you remember before waking up?&#x201d;<br><br>Stone thought about that. &#x201c;I was at a party in my home,&#x201d; he said finally, &#x201c;celebrating the marriage of some friends. I remember the police commissioner gave them both medals.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They were both police officers who had recently behaved in a courageous manner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What was the date of the party?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, the fourteenth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was four days ago,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Stone gulped. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lost four days?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It would appear so. You ingested or were injected with a drug called hypnotol. You may remember that it was a popular sleeping medication about eight years ago, until several people died from taking it, and some others who had taken too much suffered memory loss, usually temporary, sometimes permanent. Based on your bloodwork, I would describe the dosage you received as too much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who injected me? I assume that&#x2019;s why I had tape on my arm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s from drawing blood and administering an IV. If you didn&#x2019;t take the drug yourself, then someone probably gave you something to drink that had been doctored. The right dosage would have made you into a sort of walking, talking zombie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And destroyed my memory of the last four days?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Presumably.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Including traveling from New York to Paris?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A reasonable assumption.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How did I get to the American Embassy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A kindly taxi driver picked you up at the airport but couldn&#x2019;t understand what you were saying, and when you passed out, he went through your wallet.&#x201d; He got up, went to the door, and returned with the shopping bag that had been hanging there. He reached into the bag and came up with a zippered plastic sack containing what Stone recognized as the normal contents of his pockets, including his passport and wallet, and emptied it onto the table. Keeler opened the wallet, removed a card, and handed it to Stone. It read &#x201c;Holly Barker, Assistant Director of Intelligence.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That got the attention of a marine guard at the front gate.&#x201d; He handed Stone a CIA ID with his picture on it. &#x201c;So did this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; Stone said.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been unable to reach Ms. Barker,&#x201d; Keeler said. &#x201c;She is away from her office at some sort of retreat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Retreat? That doesn&#x2019;t sound like Holly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In any case, once we had made you as comfortable as we could here and sent your blood for analysis, someone typed your name into a computer and came up with a very interesting CIA file that identified you as a consultant to the Agency, hence the ID card.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is correct,&#x201d; Stone said.<br><br>&#x201c;And you are also an attorney with the New York law firm of Woodman &amp; Weld?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Correct.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have any idea why you came to Paris? Had you been planning a trip?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I had not, and I have no idea why I came here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You had a first-class, round-trip ticket on Air France,&#x201d; Keeler said, &#x201c;with two baggage claim stubs but no baggage. We&#x2019;re checking into that now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you. Why do you have a room like this in an embassy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s actually in that part of the building dedicated to the intelligence services. Sometimes we have . . . guests.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The clothes you were wearing have been cleaned and pressed. Why don&#x2019;t you get into them, and I&#x2019;ll introduce you to some other people here.&#x201d; He got up and left the room.<br><br>Stone got dressed.<br><br><b>2</b><br><br>Dr. Keeler returned to the little room. &#x201c;Come with me,&#x201d; he said. Stone got into his blazer and followed.<br><br>They walked down a corridor, then into a large room divided into cubicles where men and women were at work. There seemed to be an unusually large number of monitors on their desks. They passed half a dozen glassed-in offices, then stopped at a closed door. Keeler rapped on it, then looked up at the ceiling, where a camera peered back at him. The door made a clicking noise and Keeler opened it.<br><br>They stepped into a large, comfortably furnished office where a man in his mid-forties with thick, graying hair spilling into his eyes was talking with a man and a woman. Stone reflexively appreciated that the woman was in her mid-thirties and quite beautiful.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Barrington,&#x201d; Keeler said, &#x201c;this is Whit Douglas, our station chief. The lady is Rose Ann Faber, our chief of analysis, and the other gentleman is Richard LaRose, who does God-knows-what around here.&#x201d;<br><br>Stone shook their hands, and the group moved to a seating area with a sofa and some comfortable chairs.<br><br>&#x201c;How are you feeling, Mr. Barrington?&#x201d; Douglas asked.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Stone, please, and I&#x2019;m feeling reasonably well, I guess, sort of jet-lagged.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the drug,&#x201d; Keeler said. &#x201c;Your state of consciousness for the past few days would have prevented jet lag.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have I really been unconscious for four days?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the doctor said, &#x201c;as I mentioned before, you were walking and talking for part of the time. You probably weren&#x2019;t drugged until the day before yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why do you say that?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br><br>&#x201c;You would have had to be reasonably sober in order to make the decision to travel to Paris, not to mention getting through security and onto an airplane.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t remember getting on the airplane.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The drug has obliterated four days of your memory,&#x201d; the doctor explained, &#x201c;which may or may not return. The obliteration need not occur at the time of receiving the drug&#x2014;it can work backwards and erase earlier memory, too. There have been cases where people have lost several weeks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We hope your memory returns,&#x201d; Whit Douglas said, &#x201c;because we want to know how a consultant to the Agency happened to get ahold of a giant Mickey Finn, and we want to know why.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So do I,&#x201d; Stone replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you remember talking to anyone on the airplane?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember being on the airplane,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;If my memory returns, when will that start happening?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At any time,&#x201d; Keeler said. &#x201c;You could start getting flashbacks immediately or in a couple of days. If you don&#x2019;t get anything back in that time, you&#x2019;re probably faced with the permanent loss of those four days.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a rap at the door. Douglas pressed a button on the coffee table and let in a young man, who walked across the room, Stone&#x2019;s airline ticket in his hand. &#x201c;Mr. Barrington, we&#x2019;ve found your luggage. It was in the tank at De Gaulle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tank?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A pressure chamber that limits the effect of an explosion. The airlines get nervous these days when there&#x2019;s unclaimed baggage. Would you like the bags sent to your hotel?&#x201d;<br><br>Stone thought about it. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if I have a hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where did you stay the last time you were in Paris?&#x201d; Douglas asked.<br><br>&#x201c;At the Bristol, but I didn&#x2019;t like the location, so I don&#x2019;t think I would have booked in there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can we book a room for you somewhere?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, how about the Plaza Ath�n�e?&#x201d;<br><br>Douglas nodded to the young man, and he left.<br><br>Stone dug out his iPhone. &#x201c;I should call my secretary,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Maybe she can help with the memory.&#x201d; His phone was dead.<br><br>&#x201c;Use the one on my desk,&#x201d; Douglas said. &#x201c;Give the operator the number.&#x201d;<br><br>Stone did as he was told, and Joan, his secretary, picked up the phone.<br><br>&#x201c;Woodman &amp; Weld,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Mr. Barrington&#x2019;s office.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, it&#x2019;s Stone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, where the hell have you been? Your hotel said you never checked in, Dino&#x2019;s on his honeymoon, and Holly has vanished.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What hotel is that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Plaza Ath�n�e. That&#x2019;s where you said you were staying.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I had to make a detour,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Listen, I need your help. Describe to me what I did between Dino&#x2019;s engagement party and right now.&#x201d;<br><br>Joan thought this over for a moment. &#x201c;You want me to tell you what you were doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. Pretend I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Stone pressed the speaker button so the others could hear.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, you got to your desk late the day after the party, then you had lunch with Bill Eggers and had a meeting at the firm, then you got back here around five, and I went home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How about the next day?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The same, pretty much. With Dino gone and Holly moved out, you didn&#x2019;t have anybody to play with.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And the day after that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You got a call from somebody in the middle of the afternoon, then said you were going to Paris for a few days. An envelope arrived by messenger with a first-class, round-trip ticket on Air France, and a note saying a car would pick you up at seven that evening. There was no return address on the envelope. You were due into Paris at nine the next morning.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did I see anybody in my office?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did anybody call that you didn&#x2019;t know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, but I was in the ladies&#x2019; when the afternoon call came, and you picked up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you think of anything else? What did I do in the evenings?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like I said, you didn&#x2019;t have anybody to play with, so I guess you dined at home alone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, we&#x2019;ll talk again later.&#x201d; Stone hung up and went back to the sofa. &#x201c;Not much help, huh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rose Ann,&#x201d; Douglas said, &#x201c;find out who called Stone&#x2019;s office in the afternoon day before yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>Stone gave her his business card, and she went to the phone on Douglas&#x2019;s desk, then returned. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll have it in a few minutes,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>The phone rang, and Douglas picked it up and listened, then hung up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re booked into the Plaza Ath�n�e. They were expecting you yesterday. We got you an upgrade.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something missing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My briefcase. I always travel with a briefcase.&#x201d;<br><br>Douglas got up. &#x201c;Oh, I forgot.&#x201d; He walked behind his desk, came back with Stone&#x2019;s briefcase, and handed it to him. &#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t open it. Three zeros didn&#x2019;t work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The CIA couldn&#x2019;t get into a briefcase?&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the world coming to?&#x201d; He unlocked the briefcase and opened it. &#x201c;Euros,&#x201d; he said, holding up a thick envelope containing a stack of notes secured by a rubber band.<br><br>&#x201c;That reminds me,&#x201d; Douglas said. &#x201c;We gave the cabdriver a hundred.&#x201d;<br><br>Stone extracted a hundred-euro note from the stack, handed it to him, then put the rest into his inside pocket with his passport. &#x201c;Nothing unusual in the case,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;My iPad and charger, some stationery, no business papers.&#x201d; He closed the briefcase.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, we won&#x2019;t keep you,&#x201d; Douglas said, rising.<br><br>Stone got to his feet and shook hands with everybody.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d like to know if and what you start remembering,&#x201d; Douglas said, handing him a card. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my direct line and cell number. Doc, will you walk him to our side entrance? There&#x2019;s a car and driver waiting for you there, Stone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Whit, and I thank all of you for taking me in.&#x201d;<br><br>Keeler led him on a short walk to an exterior door and opened it for him. &#x201c;The car&#x2019;s through there,&#x201d; he said, waving Stone through the door and pointing at the walkway to a wrought-iron gate. &#x201c;Right down the garden path.

M. W. Turner is one of the most famousand most mysterious of artists. His paintings are among the masterpieces of Western art, and the range of his work and the originality of his technique make him a giant. He kept his private life a secret, and his contradictory personality, his love of mystification, and his revolutionary manner of painting all fascinated his contemporaries and still arouse our curiosity today.<br><br> Andrew Wilton's knowledge and enthusiasm uniquely qualify him to introduce us to the artist's life, and he concentrates here on original sources: Turner's writings, in the form of letters, notes, and verse; impressions recorded by his contemporaries; and reviews of his exhibited works. A comprehensive illustrated chronology covers Turner's travels, exhibitions, and projects, and includes portraits of his friends and patrons, views of places with which he was associated, and works by other artists who played a crucial role in forming his style and thought.<br><br> 186 illustrations, 164 in color</p><p>Andrew Wilton was the first curator of the Core Gallery for the Turner Collection at Tate Britain, London, and is the author of many books on the artist.Turner, painter of great seascapes, looked a bit like a sailor; he called himself "Admiral Booth" among friends; he did virtuoso improvisations at the Royal Academy; he was frequently stung by critics, like the reviewer who accused him of painting with "soapsuds and whitewash." Wilton, curator of London's Tate Gallery, has assembled the known facts of Turner's life, interweaving passages from the artist's letters and notes, reviews and comments by contemporaries. Besides offering candid glimpses of an intensely private genius, this sumptuously illustrated study is especially valuable in briging to light little-known phases of his prolific, endlessly inventive career. Here are astonishing color experiments made on the Moselle River, huge monochrome pencil drawings, picturesque scenes of life on the road, brooding oils of architectural interiors, remarkable watercolors on blue paper, romantic mezzotints and a host of other marvels. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rich Mullins: Home</h2><p>This endearing book contains more than 60 pages of Rich&#39;s thoughts about life and faith as written for RELEASE Magazine from 1991-1996.

And in The Little Book of Letting Go, he offers a simple three-step process for shedding prejudices, preconceptions, and prejudgments and facing each moment with openness and enthusiasm. Prather first explains why it is essential to learn to let go and then outlines a 30-day plan for spiritual renewal. Finally, he offers specific techniques for getting a grip on habitual reactions, the need to control, and the addiction to conflict.</p><p>Bestselling author Hugh Prather has a knack for putting his finger on the pulse of America's emotional and spiritual angst. In <i>The Little Book of Letting Go</i> he gives voice to the internal chatter that prevents us from enjoying or pursuing our true desires. "Within our human heart we all feel the call to be simple, to be present, to be real," Prather writes. "Yet throughout the day, the world urges us to be at war with ourselves and each other: 'Be resentful about the past.' 'Be anxious about the future.' 'Be dissatisfied with what you do see.' 'Be guilty.' 'Be important.' 'Be bored.'" Prather compares these thoughts to the stale clutter in the back of our refrigerators. By cleaning out our minds, we allow room for fresher and more nourishing foods for thought.<p> In this little book on mental cleansing, Prather uses personal stories as well as step-by-step exercises to help readers understand the rewards and the process of letting go. For example, in the section on letting go of guilt and hurtful actions, Prather suggests that for at least one day readers "rise from sleep and make your purpose only this: 'I will go through this day harmlessly. I will hurt no one in my thoughts or in my actions, including myself.'" Prather includes numerous similar kinds of assignments in all of his chapters, including how to let go of..."Mental Pollutants," "Misery," "Prediction and Control," and "Spiritual Specialness." <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p>Hugh Prather is the author of 16 books, including <i>Spiritual Notes to Myself, Love and Courage, The Little Book of Letting Go, How to Live in the World and Still Be Happy</i>, and <i>Shining Through</i>.

She is also the author of <i>A Kiss of Shadows</i> and <i>A Caress of Twilight</i>. She lives in a suburb of St. Louis with her family.[Editor&#39;s Note: This is a combined review with BLOOD NOIR]--Vampire hunter Anita Blake returns in Hamilton&#39;s popular series. Narrator Cynthia Holloway does little voicing, and this approach works well because most of the story&#39;s characters are male, and male voices are a challenge for her. Still, her wonderful delivery has lots of inflection and feeling, and her treatment of the erotic scenes in Hamilton&#39;s work is exquisite. The book is replete with a multitude of &#34;were-animals&#34;--from rats to lions, tigers, and leopards, as well as the traditional werewolf. Holloway&#39;s use of a variant pronunciation of this key word form throughout is a distraction. Still, this production will succeed with lovers of vampire fantasy, especially those who enjoy Hamilton&#39;s treatment of eroticism.

A detached and wary observer of others, Lily reluctantly finds herself investigating the murder of one of her employers, Deedra Dean, in her latest engaging outing (after 1998's Shakespeare's Christmas). It's Lily's misfortune to discover Deedra's violated body in her car on a deserted road, the apparent victim of a tryst gone sour. For Lily, who already knows more than she wants about the promiscuous young woman's habits, the details don't add up. Since many of her other clients are related to Deedra, Lily endures their catty, sometimes malicious gossip, but when she helps Deedra's mother clean out the dead woman's apartment, she quietly disposes of Deedra's collection of compromising photos and videos. The nature of the crime forces Lily to deal with her own scars, legacies of the brutal abduction and rape in Memphis that sent her scrambling for the tranquil environs of Shakespeare. A wise, self-counseled soul, as well as a skilled karate student and fitness buff, Lily is just foolhardy enough to charge into a burning house to save a frail, mean old man. Indeed, Lily has such an engaging voice, full of pain and redemption, that the collecting of clues and the unfolding of the crime take a back seat to her personal story.

And now comes a book that reminds us of the glory of being Southern! Just when you thought the liberal press had succeeded in grinding us into the ground with their barrage of derogatory patter, a glimmer of hope emerges, and Southerners are once again discovering that being Southern is a good thing after all-just like it used to be! If you are proud of your Southern heritage, you'll rejoice in Southern by the Grace of God. Many of us are proud to be Southern, but we don't know just why. Since Southern history has been purged from the textbooks that children study today, our youth have little conception of a heritage. Even some of us that are older are not well grounded in it either.

He took his books home and started to wonder about the thing they called the ``Civil War.�� Finally, his mother sat him down and explained very concisely, ``Well, let me tell you how it was. Lee was the good guy, and Grant was the bad guy.�� And Grissom says ``it stuck. I remain solidly convinced to this day that my mother was right.�� Born and raised in South Central Oklahoma, Grissom�s first calling was music. He received bachelor�s and master�s degrees in music education as well as minors in instrumental music and social studies from the University of Oklahoma. He then taught history and music for several years in secondary schools in Norman and Wynnewood, Oklahoma. After serving as a vocalist and pianist in several musical groups ranging from barbershop quartets to jazz bands, Grissom formed ``The Rebels,�� a country music/gospel band that recorded in Nashville and traveled throughout Dixie. A die-hard Southerner, Grissom�s writing career began when he realized there were no all-inclusive books about the heritage of the South; and most importantly in this age of South-bashing, there were few, if any, modern-day books that presented the South in a positive light. Since he felt that it was high time for a strong defense of the South and that no Southern literary figure would write the needed books, he decided to take on that challenge. Grissom began researching and writing at the same time and drew from his natural Southern background. He defined his goal as ``to reinsure the South so that we don�t give up any more of our flags, our traditions, and the celebration of our priceless legacy.�� Beginning with Southern by the Grace of God, a celebration of things Southern ; followed by The Last Rebel Yell, a call to the defense of Southern life against all those attempting to tear down Southern culture; and finally, When the South Was Southern , a reminiscence of bygone days, Grissom has compiled a comprehensive trilogy on the culture of the South that people have responded to with an enthusiastic, almost religious fervor. A former member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, he is the recipient of several awards including the 1975 Oklahoma Heritage Award and the Jefferson Davis Medal. Moving from Nashville back to Wynnewood, Oklahoma, in 1994 after the death of his father, Grissom misses his music. But he stays busy with his full-time writing career and radio talk-show interviews, which are his ``forte.�� Grissom says, ``When they start on the Southern stuff, the phones light up.��</p><h2>Being Mortal Illness, Medicine and What Matters in the End</h2><p>Brand New Book. Ready to be shipped.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2014:</strong> True or false: Modern medicine is a miracle that has transformed all of our lives.</p> <p>If you said &#x201c;true,&#x201d; you&#x2019;d be right, of course, but that&#x2019;s a statement that demands an asterisk, a &#x201c;but.&#x201d; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine,&#x201d; writes Atul Gawande, a surgeon (at Brigham and Women&#x2019;s Hospital in Boston) and a writer (at the New Yorker). &#x201c;We think. . .[it] is to ensure health and survival. But really. . .it is to enable well-being. And well-being is about the reasons one wishes to be alive.&#x201d; Through interviews with doctors, stories from and about health care providers (such as the woman who pioneered the notion of &#x201c;assisted living&#x201d; for the elderly)&#x2014;and eventually, by way of the story of his own father&#x2019;s dying, Gawande examines the cracks in the system of health care to the aged (i.e. 97 percent of medical students take no course in geriatrics) and to the seriously ill who might have different needs and expectations than the ones family members predict. (One striking example: the terminally ill former professor who told his daughter that &#x201c;quality of life&#x201d; for him meant the ongoing ability to enjoy chocolate ice cream and watch football on TV. If medical treatments might remove those pleasures, well, then, he wasn&#x2019;t sure he would submit to such treatments.) Doctors don&#x2019;t listen, Gawande suggests&#x2014;or, more accurately, they don&#x2019;t know what to listen for. (Gawande includes examples of his own failings in this area.) Besides, they&#x2019;ve been trained to want to find cures, attack problems&#x2014;to win. But victory doesn&#x2019;t look the same to everyone, he asserts. Yes, &#x201c;death is the enemy,&#x201d; he writes. &#x201c;But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don&#x2019;t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don&#x2019;t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee... someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; In his compassionate, learned way, Gawande shows all of us&#x2014;doctors included&#x2014;how mortality must be faced, with both heart and mind. &#x2013; <i>Sara Nelson</i></p><p><b>Atul Gawande</b> is the author of <i>The Checklist Manifesto</i>, <i>Better</i>, and <i>Complication</i>s.

Woody Guthrie&#39;s powerful lyrics and Kathy Jakobsen&#39;s detailed paintings invite readers on a journey across the country, creating an unforgettable portrait of our diverse land and the people who live it. 32 pp with 1 gatefold.</p><p>Woody Guthrie is one of America's best-known folksingers. His daughter, Nora Guthrie, is the director of the Woody Guthrie archives in New York city.<br><br>Kathy Jakobsen is one of America's premier folk artists and author of the best-selling My New York.<br>From California to the New York island, readers of all ages will be singing the praises of this picture-book tribute to a legendary folk musician and one of his best-known compositions. The popular version of the song, which Guthrie recorded in 1949, omitted some of Guthrie's original lyrics. Restored here, those verses broaden the song, transforming it to an anthem for the downtrodden: "In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people;/ By the relief office I seen my people;/ As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking,/ Is this land made for you and me?" Acclaimed folk artist Jakobsen's (My New York) expansive, sparkling oil landscapes depict the natural beauty of the country?a stand of redwoods, a country campground, etc. In several multi-paneled spreads, Guthrie stars as wandering troubadour, carrying his guitar from coast to coast and landmark to landmark (all clearly labeled). These spreads are bordered with geometric designs inspired by traditional "tramp art" carvings, while their corners contain hand-lettered snippets of Guthrie lyrics and quotes. One memorable page features a star-studded cast of musicians who have performed Guthrie's songs over the years and also a roster of artists who played at a Woody Guthrie tribute concert in 1996, all of whom are identified in small print. As an added bonus, the final pages contain a tribute from fellow singer/songwriter Pete Seeger; a brief biography of Guthrie, illustrated with black-and-white family photographs; and complete music and lyrics to "This Land Is Your Land." This beautiful homage to America and to a favorite folksinger is sure to be a family treasure.

Called in on special cases where his skills are particularly needed, he works as a tracker. The media dubs him "The Human Bloodhound," since Steps is renowned for his incredible ability to find and follow trails over any surface better than anyone else. But there's a secret to his success. Steps has a special ability---a kind of synesthesia---where he can see the 'essence' of a person, something he calls 'shine,' on everything they've touched. His ability is known to only a few people---his father, the director of the FBI, and his partner, Special Agent Jimmy Donovan.</p><p>When the remains of a murdered woman are found, Steps recognizes the shine left by the murderer from another crime scene with a physically similar victim. And he uncovers the signature at both scenes---the mark of a sad face. At the same time, another killer, one Steps has dubbed Leonardo and has been trying to track for over ten years, appears again, taunting Steps. But while Steps tries to find a clue that will lead him to Leonardo, the case of the Sad Face Killer heats up. The team uncovers eleven possible victims: missing women who fit the same pattern. Using his skill and the resources of the Bureau, it is a race against time to find the killer before it's too late.</p></p><p>SPENCER KOPE is the Crime Analyst for the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office.

Since the late 1970s, Witkin&#x2019;s black-and-white portraits and still-lifes of hermaphrodites, body parts, severed heads, mutilations and similar themes have inevitably provided shock fodder to the religious right, while seeming to evoke an easy relationship to ideas of decadence and morbidity. For Witkin, the goal is simple: &#x201c;I wanted my photographs to be as powerful as the last thing a person sees or remembers before death.&#x201d; Witkin&#x2019;s photographs offer up examples of life&#x2019;s extremities as unblinking confrontations with mortality, whose power derives not merely from their content but from the keen compositional instincts governing that content. Witkin&#x2019;s gift for still life and his use of religious motifs such as crucifixion and sainthood have been nourished by his appreciation of the likes of Francisco Goya, Odilon Redon and Hieronymus Bosch, whose examples he has translated for the concerns of the present. Witkin&#x2019;s photographs have made a colossal impact upon contemporary culture, influencing artists such as the Chapman Brothers and Erwin Olaf, musicians such as Diamanda Gal�s and Trent Reznor, and the late fashion designer Alexander McQueen, among many others. <i>Vanitas</i> provides a cross-section of the artist&#x2019;s work from the 1970s to the present. In addition to photographs, it includes many lesser-known drawings and paintings, as well as Witkin&#x2019;s most recent, previously unpublished photographs. A bilingual (English/Czech) text by the art historian Otto M. Urban summarizes the development of Witkin&#x2019;s life and work.<br><b>Joel-Peter Witkin</b> was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1939, and lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><p>Witkin's bizarre explorations of pain, sex, death, morality and the human psyche are not for the faint of heart. "When people see my work, there is no 'gray area' of response," he notes in this wide-ranging retrospective. "What they experience is either love or hate." We're inclined toward the former. (<i>American Photo</i>)</p><h2>On a Dark Night I Left My Silent House</h2><p>A short, powerful new novel by one of the greatest writers in the German language<br><br><i>On a Dark Night I Left My Silent House</i> is Peter Handke's evocative, moving, often fantastic, novel about one man's conflict with himself and his journey toward resolution. During one night shift, an unnamed, middle-aged pharmacist in Taxham, an isolated suburb of Salzburg, tells his story to a narrator. The pharmacist is known and well-respected, but lonely and estranged from his wife. He feels most comfortable wandering about in nature, collecting and eating hallucinogenic mushrooms. One day he receives a blow to the head that leaves him unable to speak, and the narrative is transformed from ironic description into a collection of sensual impressions, observations and reflections. The pharmacist, who is now called the driver, sets out on a quest, travelling into the Alps with two companions--a former Olympic skiing champion and a formerly famous poet--where he is beaten and later stalked by a woman. He drives through a tunnel and has a premonition of death, then finds himself in a surreal, foreign land. In a final series of bizarre, cathartic events, the driver regains his speech and is taken back to his pharmacy--back to his former life, but forever changed. A powerful, poetic exploration of language, longing and dislocation in the human experience, <i>On a Dark Night I Left My Silent House</i> reveals Handke at his magical best.<br></p><p><b>Peter Handke</b> was born in Griffen, Austria in 1942. His many works include <i>The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick</i> (FSG, 1972), <i>A Sorrow Beyond Dreams</i> (FSG, 1975), <i>Slow Homecoming</i> (FSG, 1985), <i>Absence</i> (FSG, 1990), <i>The Jukebox and Other Essays on Storytelling</i> (FSG, 1994), and most recently, <i>My Year in the No-Man's-Bay</i> (FSG, 1998).<br>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>So What: The Life of Miles Davis</h2><p>Based on interviews with family and friends, this account of the jazz great&#39;s life reveals the influence of Miles Davis&#39; life on his work as well as the musician&#39;s persistent desire to re-invent himself.</p><p><b>John Szwed</b> is the John M. Musser Professor of Anthropology, African American Studies, Music, and American Studies at Yale University. He is the author of a number of books, including an introductory book about jazz, <i>Jazz 101,</i> and a biography, <i>Space Is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Ra.</i>Jazz genius Davis once said, "Don't you try to make me into a nice guy." Yale professor Szwed neither sentimentalizes nor attacks his subject in this impressive biography, concentrating instead on the fascinating contradictions that led to Davis's artistic greatness. The son of a successful dentist in Illinois, Davis (1926-1991) showed talent for the trumpet early and followed his vision despite disapproval from his mother. He attended Juilliard, married a girl from the wrong side of the tracks and joined Charlie Parker's group, struggling to find his style and overcome feelings of inadequacy against Parker's exhilarating brilliance. While pointing out Davis's love for altering chord progressions and his skill at sketching arrangements in literally seconds, Szwed tracks a life that eventually spiraled out of control. Unsparing accounts of the musician's cocaine and alcohol addiction transcend Davis's life and become a larger portrait of the traps that destroyed so many jazzmen. Davis's love affairs with Juliette Greco and Cicely Tyson grippingly illuminate the narcissism, sexual hunger and violence that made lasting relationships impossible. Szwed offers crisply detailed backstories to such masterpieces as Sketches of Spain, Round About Midnight and Miles Ahead. His prose has a musical pulse, and he highlights the most significant element of Davis's soul: "he told every woman he became involved with that music always came first, before family, children, lovers, friends." Davis's music has been called a "divine disease," and this in-depth study clarifies the nature of that compulsive, satisfying malady in a way that will enlighten listeners and musicians.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Van Gogh (Masters of Art)</h2><p>This exciting new art series combines the most popular artists with expert text and a fresh, unique, format destined to appeal to children and adults alike. Each of the Rizzoli Quadrifolios features sixteen foldout pages that open into huge poster-sized reproductions of the work, allowing readers to feel as though they have leaped into work itself. The series begins with two artists whose work continually compels audiences: Michelangelo and Van Gogh. Vincent Van Gogh features a variety of the best-known paintings by the Dutch artist, whose work continually breaks records at auctions. A tour of Van Gogh's portraits will travel to major American museums throughout 200 and 2001.<br></p><p>No other painter better embodies the idea of the tortured artist than <i>Vincent van Gogh</i>. Modern-art historian Meyer Schapiro recognizes this when he states that "what is most important is that van Gogh converted all this aspiration and anguish into his art, which thus became the first example of a truly personal art, art as a deeply lived means of spiritual deliverance or transformation of the self...." What naturally follows from Schapiro is not only a synopsis of van Gogh's artistic career and personal travails, but also an insightful analysis of van Gogh's technique and handling of paint, and how they manipulate the viewer's emotional response to his paintings. With a sympathetic yet penetrating essay by Schapiro, this book is a pleasure to read for van Gogh enthusiasts of any level. The more expert art historian might prefer van Gogh's drawings, of which approximately 20 are reproduced here in black and white. It is for his paintings, however, that one admires van Gogh, and this book's 49 full-page color plates with accompanying comments by Schapiro are its strength. <i>Van Gogh</i> contains works from no less than 30 different worldwide collections to better represent all phases of the artist's development, and includes his most famous and best-loved works.Francesca Castria is an expert on nineteenth- and twentieth -century art and has collaborated with Stefano Zuffi on both <i>Art in Venice</i> and <i>Italian Painting.</i></p><h2>Something Like an Autobiography</h2><p>The distinguished filmmaker chronicles his life from his birth in 1910 to the worldwide success in 1951 of his film &#34;Rashomon&#34; and provides a provocative account of the Japanese film industry</p><p>Translated by Audie E.

This conflict between flesh and spirit, between emotional and contemplative man, was a life study for Hesse. It is a theme that transcends all time. The Hesse Phenomenon "has turned into a vogue, the vogue into a torrent. . .He has appealed both to. . . an underground and to an establishment. . .and to the disenchanted young sharing his contempt for our industrial civilization."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>Hermann Hesse was born in 1877 in Calw, Germany. He was the son and grandson of Protestant missionaries and was educated in religious schools until the age of thirteen, when he dropped out of school. At age eighteen he moved to Basel, Switzerland, to work as a bookseller and lived in Switzerland for most of his life. His early novels included <i>Peter Camenzind</i> (1904),<i> Beneath the Wheel</i> (1906), <i>Gertrud</i> (1910), and <i>Rosshalde</i> (1914). During this period Hesse married and had three sons.<br>During World War I Hesse worked to supply German prisoners of war with reading materials and expressed his pacifist leanings in antiwar tracts and novels. Hesse&#x2019;s lifelong battles with depression drew him to study Freud during this period and, later, to undergo analysis with Jung. His first major literary success was the novel <i>Demian</i> (1919).<br>When Hesse&#x2019;s first marriage ended, he moved to Montagnola, Switzerland, where he created his best-known works: <i>Siddhartha </i>(1922), <i>Steppenwolf </i>(1927), <i>Narcissus and Goldmund</i> (1930), <i>Journey to the East </i>(1932), and <i>The Glass Bead Game</i> (1943). Hesse won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946.

The lives of many people revolve around God; without God, they believe, life would be unbearable. Others regard the idea of God as the worst, most destructive, idea ever invented. The one group finds the evidence for God overwhelming; the other group finds the same for atheism. The debate has centered around the idea of God as the creator of the world. Many philosophers, theologians, and scientists have assumed that, if we would simply add up the good arguments for and against the existence of God, we could reach agreement, one way or the other. But in this book, David Ray Griffin argues that progress on this issue will be impossible unless we distinguish between two radically different ideas of a divine creator, which he calls &#x201c;Gawd&#x201d; and &#x201c;God.&#x201d; Whereas there is overwhelming evidence against the existence of Gawd, there is also overwhelming evidence for the reality of God. After looking at this evidence, the book illustrates the importance of this distinction for the issue of climate change.</p><p>David Ray Griffin is Professor of Philosophy of Religion and Theology, Emeritus, Claremont School of Theology and Claremont Graduate University, where he remains a co-director of the Center for Process Studies. He has published (as author or editor) more than 35 books in theology, philosophy, philosophy of religion, the relation between science and religion, and social and political issues.&#x201c;David Griffin, beginning with a somewhat puckish distinction between two concepts of God, makes a customarily probing, rigorous, sophisticated, and compelling case for the more believable God. All of Griffin&#x2019;s vast corpus in theology is distinguished by its profundity and relevance. This engaging book ranks very high in the Griffin corpus.&#x201d; &#x2013; <b>Gary Dorrien</b>, <i>author of Social Ethics in the Making (2010) and Kantian Reason and Hegelian Spirit (2015)</i><p> </p> &#x201c;In this book, David Ray Griffin explores in detail the usefulness of employing a different name for the deity of classical theism (Gawd), in contrast to a non-omnipotent deity (God), the best version of which, he suggests, is process or neoclassical theism. Throughout the book, there are instructive surprises as a result of this exploration. Among these are Griffin&#x2019;s insightful critiques of several major figures in contemporary analytic philosophy, including Rorty, Dworkin, Larmore, Quine, Putnam, and (his favorite) Nagel. I highly recommend this important book!&#x201d; &#x2013; <b>Daniel A.

This glaring omission&#x2014;later rectified by a panel of experts&#x2014;raised an important question: How could a first-ballot Hall of Famer, widely considered one of the greatest hitters in baseball history, still rank as the most underrated athlete of all time?<br><br>In <i>Stan Musial</i>, veteran sports journalist George Vecsey finally gives this twenty-time All-Star and St. Louis Cardinals icon the kind of prestigious biographical treatment previously afforded to his more celebrated contemporaries Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio. More than just a chronological recounting of the events of Musial&#x2019;s life, this is the definitive portrait of one of the game&#x2019;s best-loved but most unappreciated legends, told through the remembrances of those who played beside, worked with, and covered &#x201c;Stan the Man&#x201d; over the course of his nearly seventy years in the national spotlight.<br><br>Stan Musial never married a starlet. He didn&#x2019;t die young, live too hard, or squander his talent. There were no legendary displays of temper or moodiness. He was merely the most consistent superstar of his era, a scarily gifted batsman who compiled 3,630 career hits (1,815 at home and 1,815 on the road), won three World Series titles, and retired in 1963 in possession of seventeen major-league records. Away from the diamond, he proved a savvy businessman and a model of humility and graciousness toward his many fans in St. Louis and around the world. From Keith Hernandez&#x2019;s boyhood memories of Musial leaving tickets for him when the Cardinals were in San Francisco to the little-known story of Musial&#x2019;s friendship with novelist James Michener&#x2014;and their mutual association with Pope John Paul II&#x2014;Vecsey weaves an intimate oral history around one of the great gentlemen of baseball&#x2019;s Greatest Generation. <br><br>There may never be another Stan the Man, a fact that future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols&#x2014;reluctantly nicknamed &#x201c;El Hombre&#x201d; in Musial&#x2019;s honor&#x2014;is quick to acknowledge. But thanks to this long-overdue reappraisal, even those who took his greatness for granted will learn to appreciate him all over again.</p><p><p> <strong>A Look Inside <i>Stan Musial</i></strong> </p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><b>George Vecsey</b>, a sports columnist for <i>The New York Times</i>, has written about such events as the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics but considers baseball, the sport he&#x2019;s covered since 1960, his favorite game.

But this tough gal from New Jersey, an unemployed discount lingerie buyer, has a much more interesting story to tell: She has to say that her Miata has been repossessed and that she's so poor at the moment that she just drank her last bottle of beer for breakfast. She has to say that her only chance out of her present rut is her repugnant cousin Vinnie and his bail-bond business. She has to say that she blackmailed Vinnie into giving her a bail-bond recovery job worth $10,000 (for a murder suspect), even though she doesn't own a gun and has never apprehended a person in her life. And she has to say that the guy she has to get, Joe Morelli, is the same creep who charmed away her teenage virginity behind the pastry case in the Trenton bakery where she worked after school.<p> If that hard-luck story doesn't sound compelling enough, Stephanie's several unsuccessful attempts at pulling in Joe make a downright hilarious and suspenseful tale of murder and deceit. Along the way, several more outlandish (but unrelentingly real) characters join the story, including Benito Ramirez, a champion boxer who seems to be following Stephanie Plum wherever she goes.</p><p> Janet Evanovich shares an authentic feel for the streets of Trenton in her debut mystery (she developed her talents in a string of romance novels before creating Ms. Plum), and her tough, frank, and funny first-person narrator offers a winning mix of vulgarity and sensitivity.

There is no more proper instrument of analysis of our contemporary myths than this book one of the most significant works in French theory, and one that has transformed the way readers and philosophers view the world around them.Our age is a triumph of codification. We own devices that bring the world to the command of our fingertips. We have access to boundless information and prodigious quantities of stuff. We decide to like or not, to believe or not, to buy or not. We pick and choose. We think we are free. Yet all around us, in pop culture, politics, mainstream media, and advertising, there are codes and symbols that govern our choices. They are the fabrications of consumer society. They express myths of success, well-being, or happiness. As Barthes sees it, these myths must be carefully deciphered, and debun</p><p><p>Roland Barthes was born in 1915.

He was a distinguished American journalist, satirist and novelist. Cleveland died aged 81 in 1998, and was buried next to his beloved cat, Polar Bear.Cleveland Amory is renowned for his lifetime work in support of animal welfare, and he has written many books on the subject. A popular one is recorded here--Amory's life and musings on a rescued alley cat ultimately dubbed "Polar Bear." It could be that on the page this is a witty and amusing tale, but read by Alan Sklar with overbearing and mawkish good humor, its appeal is compromised. Amory is a fair humorist and can certainly provide enough pathos for any animal lover, but Sklar so overplays it that only the most sentimental listener will enjoy this. Comedy, admittedly, is the most difficult genre to play, and the director should have detected the problems herein.

Life here is not constrained. Rather, the Four Corners of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah form a cross and the lines stretch outward to an infinite western horizon. Viewed from a southwest perspective, it is an &#x201c;X&#x201d; on a map marking the location of a hard country, part real, part illusion. <br>In the blurring of that reality and illusion, glimpsed through the schlieren of superheated air shimmering above red rock canyon floors, is a heritage of guns, desperados and violence. The land and all that flows, grows or roams wild across it belongs to those who share its history, whose great-grandparents died there&#x2014;whether shot, hung or simply worked into the ground. A distrust of outsiders and the government is instinctual. And lawbreakers both factual and fictional become mythical, from Butch Cassidy to Edward Abbey&#x2019;s George Hayduke. <br>Sentiments in Four Corners are conflicted. On the one hand, right and wrong are as self-evident as white hats and black hats. Legal nuance is guffawed at as horsepucky and peacekeepers, both the Colt .45 and the men who wielded it or its modern equivalent are consigned special esteem. <br>On the other hand, there is something romantic in the ideal of the daring, wild young outlaw thumbing his nose at the law, eluding capture at impossible odds and disappearing in the untamed expanses beyond the horizon of authority. Enough to want to overlook the wrongs and rationalize the intent, sympathize, even admire. Enough to believe that Butch Cassidy, despite Hole-in-the-Wall Gang shootouts that left bodies on the ground, never really harmed anyone. Enough to cheer for George Hayduke as a lovable vandal with a noble cause. To spur rumors, in the absence of proof otherwise, that the outlaw got away, rode into the sunset and onto the plain of legend fueled by dime novels and lurid Eastern newspaper stories&#x2014;or Web sites. <br>The duality is not surprising. It is, after all, the American Wild West, a synthesis of geography and history; supernal red sunsets and bloodstained boardwalks; the ethereal silence of a desert night and the jarring crack of gunfire; truth, exaggeration and outright fabrication. Unlike those myths borrowed and burrowed into our psyche from foreign cultures, it is one of our own making, and for better or worse, a fundamental determinant of who we are as Americans. <br>Like the land and legends that created it, the spirit of the American West is too expansive to capture in cohesive thought, yet we know it by its landmarks: individualism, excess, self-reliance, resourcefulness, impatience and, above all, freedom. <br>More than the institutionalized freedoms assured by our Constitution and body of law, it was the freedom of hidden canyons, impregnable mountains and unassailable desert. You are free not because a court says so, but because you&#x2019;ve got a fast horse and a faster gun. It is the freedom of wide-open spaces; of unregulated rivers, unturned earth, unmolested cliffs and unencumbered spirit. It is the freedom of defiance; the right to spare the other cheek and answer any provocation with escalated force. <br>It is an ethic of contradictions, as a parched desert canyon channels the occasional flash flood. Where self-reliance and independence can flow over to extreme rebuke of all law and authority. Where resolve and courage to stand your ground can become a sudden torrent of violence. It is an ethic suited to making outlaws into outlaw heroes. <br>Multimillion-dollar ski homes line Butch Cassidy Drive in the town of Telluride, Colorado, on the northeastern edge of Four Corners territory. The gentrified resort community of East Coast second-home owners is uncharacteristic of the real West that rolls endlessly across successive horizons beyond it, where the vehicle of choice is a pickup truck rather than a Prius. Where ranches aren&#x2019;t hobbies but the livelihood of fourth-generation families, and everyday life still has a raw edge to it. But Telluride was not always distinct from the West. It began as a hardscrabble mining town and it is ironic that today there is a street named after Butch Cassidy. His connection to the community is not as a founder or honorable former mayor, a civic-minded resident or leading businessman. On June 24, 1889, he robbed its bank. He stole twenty thousand dollars of the town&#x2019;s money, threatened extreme violence against any citizens who might be tempted to interfere with his theft by firing warning shots in the air and, with two accomplices from nearby Cortez, Colorado, rode as fast as he could into the wild canyons over the Utah border. It was, in fact, his first bank robbery and as the plaque on the building that now sits on the bank site proudly reminds, it was on that spot that the Butch Cassidy legend began. It is even more odd that his legacy is summoned in that particular upscale subdivision. Rich Easterners taking control of the choicest Western land were exactly the people Butch Cassidy claimed to be waging his populist war of crime against. Still, even the economic descendants of his victims find Cassidy&#x2019;s outlaw hero appeal irresistible. <br>Throughout the decade that police searched for the outlaws whose story is told in the following pages, they scolded the public time and again, &#x201c;These killers are not heroes.&#x201d; Privately they were deeply frustrated by the public&#x2019;s fascination with the fugitives. But such perverse interest was inevitable; especially considering the Wild West nature of the crime. <br>The tradition of the outlaw hero is universal but it flowered most profusely in the American West. There, the distinction between an outlaw hero and an outlaw hung was not always apparent, but the trail from repugnant criminal to popular desperado was well ridden. Something about life out-of-bounds fascinated the public and even in the face of atrocious crimes, law-abiding citizens seemed more than willing to view bad guys with nervous admiration. In moments of musing as they bent to the task of ordinary life, it was as Eugene Manlove Rhodes, the &#x201c;cowboy chronicler&#x201d; who lived in and wrote about the Old West, suggested, &#x201c;Outlaws are just more interesting than in-laws.&#x201d; <br>Part of what made the celebrated outlaws of the American West interesting was their daring crimes and reckless confrontations&#x2014;in-your-face close and brazenly public. Stripped of one-hundred-plus years of fanciful pop-culture embellishment and decades of Hollywood gilding, Western gunfights were usually less knightly than legend portrays. Many were ambushes, back shootings or long-range shootouts with adversaries crouched behind cover. But others were eye-to-eye with mortal danger so imminent that a reasonable man would slip away and find someplace safe to puke. To engage in them required courage and public opinion turned on such displays of bravery, regardless of what color hat the gunman was wearing. <br>The one other standard of behavior consistently expected of our outlaw heroes was adherence to an outlaw code of honor. It was an unspoken, ill-defined standard of morality above the law that could overlook unwarranted violence, but required a measure of personal integrity: loyalty to friends and gang members, discrimination between adversaries and bystanders, and straightforward actions. If they were going to steal from you, they robbed you right up front, not by a Ponzi scheme. If they were going to kill you, they rode up and shot you. They were, in most respects, true to their word, transparent in their motivations and intentions. <br>Although not cheered as revolutionaries or vanguards of a particular political cause, Western outlaw heroes were associated with a populist philosophy. They cultivated the same &#x201c;true citizen and patriot&#x201d; image claimed by today&#x2019;s militia movement. In writings attributed to Butch Cassidy, he describes himself as &#x201c;a citizen of the United States against cattle barons.&#x201d; And in another reference, &#x201c;an outlaw fighting for settlers&#x2019; rights against large cattle companies.&#x201d; In a West where settlers sought the American Dream but where few found riches, on land they worked but of which the largest, most profitable pieces were owned by British and Eastern cattle conglomerates, railroad magnates and mining companies, it was a popular image. Even if the outlaws didn&#x2019;t redistribute their loot Robin Hood style, they were heroes just for sticking it to the establishment. <br>There is one more element common to leading Western outlaw heroes&#x2014;they got away, at least according to legend. Their ability to remain at large for years despite significant efforts to capture them bewitched the public. Better yet, some outlaws were, by legend, never captured at all. They simply eluded the law and disappeared. Jesse James lived on by the wishful thinking of his public, despite the fact that his body was positively identified by the scars of former wounds, put on ice and photographed. Billy the Kid and Butch Cassidy&#x2019;s final escapes are also based on popular rumors, but the historical record leaves room to believe that for each man, the rumor could be true. The truth, however, is not the point. We want them to have escaped. Their wild, unbounded outlaw freedom and wholehearted disregard for authority captures the public imagination and has us in some small manner rooting for the bad guy. <br>But the main reason the ideal of an outlaw hero resonates so broadly in our society, why we have created a peculiarly American variety within our broader national myth of the American West is that the Western outlaw hero is a twisted extension of core American values. <br>The desperate outlaw on the run not only had the freedom of the free-roaming cowboy disengaged with society; he pushed back at subjugating social forces&#x2014;the relentless press of civilization and regulation. For however long he could stay at large, the systematic oppression of government, bureaucracy, corporations, technology&#x2014;of ordinary do-the-right-thing life&#x2014;was overthrown. Like standing on the rim of a mesa staring westward across miles of jagged, wild country and feeling not small, but distinct and vital, the outlaw speaks to our elemental ache for individualism. The voice may not have sufficient force to drown out our social conscience or sway our better judgment that an uncaptured outlaw is a menace, but it&#x2019;s a whisper loud enough to intrigue, to rationalize and romanticize, and in the right circumstances transform a villain into a hero. <br>It is the myth of the West as much as the reality that forges our national identity. One of the great propagators of the myth, Western moviemaker John Ford, put it best in the 1962 classic, <i>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i>. &#x201c;This is the West. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.&#x201d; <br>Hardwired by a Western narrative of guns and frontier justice, we revel in the positive attributes of strength, courage and daring action even as they open the door for acts of violence. In cheering for the outlaw hero, we are making a psychological stand for freedom, standing up to authoritarianism and dehumanizing social forces, but we are also sanctioning brutal, inhuman antisocial behavior. Historian Frederick Jackson Turner, whose preeminent Frontier Thesis first asserted that the American character was formed by the Western experience, warned of the danger of &#x201c;pressing individual liberty beyond its proper bounds.&#x201d; The proper balance is as elusive as Butch Cassidy. <br>Dynamite Dan Clifton was known as &#x201c;the most killed outlaw in America.&#x201d; A cattle rustler and train robber in Oklahoma Indian Territory, he lost three fingers in an 1893 gunfight while riding with the Doolin Gang. He was a relatively minor criminal for the times, not destined for the outlaw hall of fame. Nevertheless Clifton accumulated a sizable bounty on his head&#x2014;thirty-five hundred dollars. It was enough that posses would constantly turn in a shot-up corpse claiming the reward, but the ten-fingered bodies were quickly identified as someone other than Dynamite Dan. In those cases where the bounty hunters had the foresight to cut fingers off the unfortunate soul they had shot to pieces, they invariably chose the wrong three fingers. <br>Like Dynamite Dan, the Old West is forever vanishing, but never vanished. It is a way of life successively pronounced dead, allowing each generation in its lament to appreciate it more poignantly. The West most Americans hold in their minds, the unfenced foundational West of open-range grazing and long cattle drives, was barely of drinking age when it was reportedly strangled to death by the barbwire. <br>It died again a few years later when the 1890 census found the nation no longer had a contiguous line of settlement. American civilization stretched from Plymouth Rock to San Francisco Bay and the frontier was closed. But in case those who lived in the West hadn&#x2019;t noticed, the Census Bureau published another obituary after the 1900 census: with an average population of two people per square mile, the West was officially &#x201c;settled.&#x201d; <br>Some believed it. Western artist Frederic Remington wrote wistfully, &#x201c;I knew the wild riders and vacant land were about to vanish forever&nbsp;&#x2026; the end of three centuries of smoke and dust and sweat.&#x201d; <br>Still, like many of its legendary outlaws and lawmen, the West refused to go down easily. Train and bank robberies, horseback posse chases and six-gun shootouts continued well into the twentieth century. Historians pushed the time of death for the Old West forward to 1920, coinciding with the end of the Mexican Revolution. But as a way of life, despite the eventual sparse web of paved roads, gasoline-powered vehicles and electrification, the West persisted. In every decade, social observers continued to note its dying flickers. Writers Zane Grey and Will James found it still taking shallow breaths in the 1920s and 1930s. Cormac McCarthy found a vanishing West set in the 1930s and 1940s. And Larry McMurtry, through his character Duane Moore, traces the slow death (or lingering life) of the West through the entire second half of the twentieth century, into the twenty-first. <br>The West lives. Despite the Walmarts and tourist information centers, the satellite dishes and Social Security, there remains a vital intrinsic West that is as it always was. Many of the attitudes, loyalties and animosities rooted in the Old West have only been fanned by the ensuing decades. In vast parts of the territory that was the historical West, there are no more residents today than there were in 1900; in many counties there are fewer. Across its vast horizon, between the larger communities that dot it, even the pockmarks of mining, timber-cutting, energy and water projects are diminished by scale. In many locations, the land features are immutable. Within the millions of acres of wilderness areas and yet unfenced country there are timeless places. You can still stand on a mountaintop and gaze across broad vistas to distant ridges. Or stare up at the same immense milky night sky that trail riders did a century ago. Or bear witness to a sunset indistinguishable from those that inspired Frederic Remington and Charles Russell. <br>Beyond the real West is the mythical West; the West of movies, books, song and video games; the West of enduring legend. It is the West that leads thousands of people every year to pull off the road and stand at the graves of Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp or Wild Bill Hickok. The West that draws millions of East Coasters and Midwesterners to vacations in the Mountain States, where they stay in accommodations with cowhide-upholstered sofas and elk-antler chandeliers. The West where the receding vibrations of a wild, audacious America still tickle the hair on the back of your neck. <br>It is real and it is mythical.

The book became a <i>New York Times </i>bestseller and the essential portrait of the most formidable terrorist enterprise of our time. Now, in <i>Manhunt,</i> Bergen picks up the thread with this taut yet panoramic account of the pursuit and killing of bin Laden. <br><br>Here are riveting new details of bin Laden&#x2019;s flight after the crushing defeat of the Taliban to Tora Bora, where American forces came startlingly close to capturing him, and of the fugitive leader&#x2019;s attempts to find a secure hiding place. As the only journalist to gain access to bin Laden&#x2019;s Abbottabad compound before the Pakistani government demolished it, Bergen paints a vivid picture of bin Laden&#x2019;s grim, Spartan life in hiding and his struggle to maintain control of al-Qaeda even as American drones systematically picked off his key lieutenants. <br><br>Half a world away, CIA analysts haunted by the intelligence failures that led to 9/11 and the WMD fiasco pored over the tiniest of clues before homing in on the man they called "the Kuwaiti"--who led them to a peculiar building with twelve-foot-high walls and security cameras less than a mile from a Pakistani military academy. This was the courier who would unwittingly steer them to bin Laden, now a prisoner of his own making but still plotting to devastate the United States. <br><br>Bergen takes us inside the Situation Room, where President Obama considers the COAs (courses of action) presented by his war council and receives conflicting advice from his top advisors before deciding to risk the raid that would change history--and then inside the Joint Special Operations Command, whose "secret warriors," the SEALs, would execute Operation Neptune Spear. From the moment two Black Hawks take off from Afghanistan until bin Laden utters his last words, <i>Manhunt</i> reads like a thriller.<br><br>Based on exhaustive research and unprecedented access to White House officials, CIA analysts, Pakistani intelligence, and the military, this is the definitive account of ten years in pursuit of bin Laden and of the twilight of al-Qaeda.</p><p><b>PETER BERGEN</b> is the author of three previous books about Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda, two of which were <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. He is CNN's national security analyst and a director of the New America Foundation. Bergen has held teaching positions at Harvard and at Johns Hopkins University and is a graduate of Oxford. He lives in Washington, DC with his wife, documentary producer Tresha Mabile, and their son.1<br><br>9/11 and After<br><br>Bin Laden was fixated on the idea that the United States was weak. In the years leading up to 9/11, he often spoke of its weakness to his followers, citing such examples as the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam in the 1970s, and from Somalia two decades later, following the Black Hawk Down incident, in which eighteen U.S. servicemen were killed. Bin Laden enjoyed recounting how al-Qaeda had slipped fighters into Somalia in 1993 to help train the Somali clans battling American forces, who were there as part of a UN mission to feed starving Somalis. &#x201c;Our boys were shocked by the low morale of the American soldier, and they realized that the American soldier was just a paper tiger,&#x201d; bin Laden exulted. His disciples eagerly agreed with the man they loved like a father.<br><br>Bin Laden assured his men that the Americans &#x201c;love life like we love death&#x201d; and would be too scared to put boots on the ground in Afghanistan. Look at what a drubbing bin Laden and his men had inflicted on the Soviets in Afghanistan! And America was every bit as feeble as the former Soviet Union, bin Laden told his nodding acolytes. Those in his inner circle who had any niggling doubt about this analysis largely kept it to themselves.<br><br>As plans for the 9/11 attacks took a more definite shape, some of al-Qaeda&#x2019;s senior officials expressed concern that the coming attacks might anger the Taliban leader Mullah Omar, to whom bin Laden had, at least notionally, sworn an oath of allegiance. During the five years that bin Laden had been the Taliban&#x2019;s honored guest, Mullah Omar and other Taliban leaders had made it clear that al-Qaeda could not use Afghanistan to conduct a freelance war against America. Bin Laden thought he could help inoculate himself against any anger caused by the attacks on the United States by offering the Taliban a highly desirable head on a platter: that of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the storied leader of what remained of the anti-Taliban resistance in Afghanistan. For the Massoud hit, bin Laden recruited two Tunisian Belgian al-Qaeda assassins, who disguised themselves as television journalists keen to interview the legendary guerrilla leader.<br><br>During the summer of 2001, while al-Qaeda groomed the Massoud assassins, the leaders of the group were putting the finishing touches on their plans for the spectacular attacks on America&#x2019;s East Coast. Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a key plotter based in Hamburg, sent a message to bin Laden on Thursday, September 6, saying that the attacks on Washington and New York would take place the following Tuesday. And on September 9, bin Laden heard the welcome news that his assassins had mortally wounded Massoud, for whom he had long harbored contempt. Now the stage was set for what bin Laden believed would be his greatest triumph: a spectacular strike on the country that was Islam&#x2019;s greatest enemy because it propped up the godless dictatorships and monarchies of the Middle East and, of course, Israel. With one tremendous blow against America, bin Laden would get the United States to pull out of the Middle East, and then Israel would fall, as would the Arab autocracies, to be replaced by Taliban-style regimes. This was bin Laden&#x2019;s fervent hope and belief.<br><br>From the day that President George W. Bush took office, January 20, 2001, every morning, six days a week, CIA official Michael Morell briefed the president about what the intelligence community believed to be the most pressing national security issues. Reed-thin and in his early forties, Morell spoke in terse, cogent paragraphs. On August 6, eight months after Bush was inaugurated, Morell met with the president at his vacation home in Texas to tell him of the CIA&#x2019;s assessment that bin Laden was determined to strike inside the United States. This briefing was heavily colored by the fact that Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian on the fringes of al-Qaeda, had recently pled guilty to charges that he planned to detonate a bomb at Los Angeles International Airport in mid-December 1999. The August 6 briefing noted that the FBI had come across information indicating &#x201c;preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks.&#x201d; After the briefing, Bush continued to enjoy the longest presidential vacation in three decades.<br><br>On the morning of September 11, 2001, in Sarasota, Florida, Morell gave the President&#x2019;s Daily Brief as usual. There was nothing memorable in it. Together with political advisor Karl Rove and press secretary Ari Fleischer, Morell got into the president&#x2019;s motorcade to head to the local elementary school where Bush planned to meet with some students. During the ride over, Fleischer asked Morell if he had heard anything about a plane hitting the World Trade Center. Morell said he hadn&#x2019;t, but would check it out with the CIA Ops Center. Officials at the Ops Center confirmed the news and quickly demolished a widely held perception: it wasn&#x2019;t a small plane that had wandered off course; it was a large commercial jet.<br><br>At the elementary school, where Bush was reading a story about a pet goat to a group of second-graders, the news came on TV that a second jet had hit the Trade Center. Bush was hustled out of the school to head to Air Force One, which took off for Barksdale Air Force Base near Shreveport, Louisiana. Fleischer was keeping careful notes that day, and the first time he recorded bin Laden&#x2019;s name was at 10:41 a.m., when Chief of Staff Andy Card said to Bush on Air Force One, &#x201c;It smells like Osama bin Laden to me.&#x201d; By then, both towers of the Trade Center had collapsed and one of the hijacked planes had plowed into the Pentagon. Bush&#x2019;s blood was boiling, and he vowed to himself, &#x201c;We are going to find out who did this, and kick their ass.&#x201d;<br><br>That same morning, bin Laden told Ali al-Bahlul, a bodyguard who doubled as his media maven, that it was &#x201c;very important to see the news today.&#x201d; Bahlul was eager to comply with his boss&#x2019;s wishes; bin Laden ruled al-Qaeda just as he lorded over his own household, as an unquestioned absolute monarch. On this day, al-Qaeda&#x2019;s leader was, as always, surrounded by his most trustworthy bodyguards, mostly Yemenis and Saudis. Like other members of al-Qaeda, the bodyguards had sworn a religious oath of personal obedience to bin Laden, rather than to his militant organization. (Similarly, those who joined the Nazi party swore an oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler, rather than to Nazism.)<br><br>Bin Laden had founded al-Qaeda in 1988, and since then he had consolidated more and more power as the unquestioned, absolute leader of the group. The conventional view is that Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian doctor and al-Qaeda&#x2019;s longtime second in command, was bin Laden&#x2019;s &#x201c;brain.&#x201d; But in making the most important strategic shift in al-Qaeda&#x2019;s history--identifying the United States as its key enemy, rather than Middle Eastern regimes--bin Laden brushed aside Zawahiri&#x2019;s obsessive focus on overthrowing the Egyptian government. Bin Laden also kept Zawahiri in the dark for years about al-Qaeda&#x2019;s most important operation--the planning for the 9/11 attacks--apprising his deputy only during the summer of 2001.<br><br>To his followers bin Laden was truly a hero, someone who they knew had given up a life of luxury as the son of a Saudi billionaire. Instead, he was living a life of danger and poverty in the service of holy war, and in person he was both disarmingly modest and deeply devout. Members of al-Qaeda modeled themselves on the man they called &#x201c;the Sheikh,&#x201d; hanging on his every pronouncement, and when they addressed him, they asked his permission to speak. His followers loved him. Abu Jandal, a Yemeni who was one of his bodyguards, described his first meeting with bin Laden in 1997 as &#x201c;beautiful.&#x201d; Another of bin Laden&#x2019;s bodyguards characterized his boss as &#x201c;a very charismatic person who could persuade people simply by his way of talking. One could say that he &#x2018;seduced&#x2019; many young men.&#x201d;<br><br>So, on the morning of September 11, bin Laden&#x2019;s crew of bodyguards eagerly set out with the man they regarded as their &#x201c;father,&#x201d; leaving his main base near the southern city of Kandahar for the mountainous region of Khost, in eastern Afghanistan. Bahlul rigged up a TV satellite receiver in a minibus that was part of bin Laden&#x2019;s caravan of vehicles, but when they reached Khost, he found it hard to get a television signal, so bin Laden tuned his radio to the BBC&#x2019;s Arabic service.<br><br>Bin Laden told his followers, &#x201c;If he [the newsreader] says: &#x2018;We have just received this . . .&#x2019; it means the brothers have struck.&#x201d; At about 5:30 in the evening local time, the BBC announcer said, &#x201c;I have just received this news. Reports from the United States say that an airliner was destroyed upon crashing into the World Trade Center in New York.&#x201d; Bin Laden told his men to &#x201c;be patient.&#x201d; Soon came the news of a second jet flying into the South Tower of the Trade Center. Bin Laden&#x2019;s bodyguards exploded with joy; their leader truly was conducting a great cosmic war against the infidels!<br><br>About eight hundred miles to the south, in the heaving Pakistani megacity of Karachi, some of bin Laden&#x2019;s most trusted lieutenants had also gathered to watch television coverage of the attacks. They were Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the portly commander of the 9/11 operation; Ramzi bin al-Shibh, an intensely religious Yemeni who was a key coordinator of the attacks; and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, the Saudi paymaster who had transferred tens of thousands of dollars to the hijackers living in the States for their flight lessons and living expenses.<br><br>Also watching TV with the three architects of 9/11 were some other al-Qaeda &#x201c;brothers.&#x201d; As the television showed the hijacked planes flying into the Trade Center, the brothers started weeping with joy, prostrating themselves, and shouting &#x201c;God is great!&#x201d; Bin al-Shibh admonished them, &#x201c;Patience! Patience! Follow the news! The matter is not over yet!&#x201d; Then came the attack on the Pentagon and the news of the fourth aircraft, which went down in Pennsylvania. The men from al-Qaeda embraced each other and wept again, this time in sadness for the brothers who had died on the hijacked planes.<br><br>Bin Laden was confident that the United States would respond to the attacks on New York and Washington only with cruise missile strikes, as it had done three years earlier, following al-Qaeda&#x2019;s attacks against two American embassies in Africa in 1998. At most, he expected the kind of air strikes that the United States and NATO had employed against the Serbs during the air war in Kosovo in 1999. The paper tiger might bare its fangs, but it wouldn&#x2019;t go in for the kill.<br><br>In Washington, news soon circulated that a Palestinian terrorist organization, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, had claimed responsibility for the attacks. Bush summoned Morell, asking, &#x201c;What do you make of this?&#x201d;<br><br>Morell replied, &#x201c;The DFLP has a history of terrorism against Israel, but its capabilities are limited. It does not have the resources and reach to do this.&#x201d;<br><br>In the early afternoon, Air Force One headed from Louisiana to Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska, home of the U.S. Strategic Command, which controls America&#x2019;s nuclear missiles. Bush asked to see Morell again, and pushed him for his opinion about who was behind the attacks. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any intelligence as yet, so what I am going to say is my personal view,&#x201d; Morell said. &#x201c;There are two terrorist states capable of conducting such a complex operation--Iran and Iraq--but neither has much to gain and everything to lose from attacking the U.S.&#x201d; He added, &#x201c;The responsible party is almost certainly a nonstate actor, and I have no doubt the trail will lead to bin Laden and al-Qaeda.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How soon will we know for sure?&#x201d; Bush asked.<br><br>Morell reviewed how long it took for the United States to determine the culprits in several previous terrorist attacks. &#x201c;We knew it was al-Qaeda within two days of the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998, but it took months in the case of the Cole bombing. Bottom line, sir, we may know very soon or it may take some time,&#x201d; Morell concluded.<br><br>In fact, it would be only a matter of hours. When Bush landed in Nebraska at around 3:30 p.m., he spoke for the first time to CIA director George Tenet. Tenet told him that the attacks &#x201c;looked, smelled, and tasted like bin Laden,&#x201d; particularly because the names of two known al-Qaeda associates, Nawaf al-Hamzi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, had been found on the passenger manifests of one of the crashed planes. For the past several months, as many as sixty CIA employees had known that Hamzi and Mihdhar were living in the United States, but they had inexplicably failed to inform the FBI.<br><br>Over the next few days, Bush and his war cabinet set in motion a plan to overthrow the Taliban in Afghanistan--unconventional in that it relied on only some four hundred U.S. Green Berets, Special Operations forces, and CIA personnel on the ground, combined with massive American firepower from the air. And on September 17, Bush signed a highly classified authorization to hunt down and, if necessary, kill the leaders of al-Qaeda, allowing the CIA great leeway as to how to get the job done. One of the top lawyers at the Agency, John Rizzo, who had joined the CIA at the height of the Cold War and who helped draft the authorization, says, &#x201c;I had never in my experience been part of or ever seen a presidential authorization as far-reaching and as aggressive in scope. It was simply extraordinary.&#x201d; The same day that Bush signed this &#x201c;finding,&#x201d; he spoke with reporters at the Pentagon, saying, &#x201c;I want justice. And there&#x2019;s an old poster out West, I recall, that said, &#x2018;Wanted, Dead or Alive.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>On September 12, at his office in Islamabad, Jamal Ismail, Abu Dhabi Television&#x2019;s correspondent in Pakistan, received a messenger from bin Laden, who told him, &#x201c;Jamal, I came last night in a hurry from Afghanistan.&#x201d; The messenger read a statement from bin Laden that, while it did not claim responsibility for the attacks, endorsed them heartily: &#x201c;We believe what happened in Washington and elsewhere against the Americans was punishment from Almighty Allah, and they were good people who did this. We agree with them.&#x201d; Ismail quickly read this message out on Abu Dhabi TV.<br><br>Ismail, a savvy Palestinian journalist long based in Pakistan, had known bin Laden on and off over the course of a decade and a half, having worked as a reporter in the mid-1980s for Jihad magazine, an organ funded by bin Laden that publicized the exploits of the Arabs then fighting the Soviets. Ismail had recently resumed his relationship with bin Laden when he interviewed him at length for a documentary profile that aired on Al Jazeera in 1999. Ismail thought that the message from bin Laden about the 9/11 attacks meant that bin Laden likely knew far more than he was publicly saying about the hijackers. &#x201c;Osama never praised anyone who is non-Muslim. From this I determined he knows something, and he&#x2019;s confident of their identity. They have links,&#x201d; Ismail said.</p><h2>The Complete Beatles Chronicle</h2><p>For Beatles lovers The Complete Beatles Chronicle will take you on the journey of the Beatles through out there career.</p><p>orgeous chronicle of the Beatles' days together, from the producer of the wildly successful <b>The Beatles: Recording Sessions</b>.

It is a process that sorts incommensurabilities and registers contradictions (which is not the same as solving them!) The inevitable and welcome conflict of interpretations - a discursive, ideological struggle - therefore needs to be supplemented by an account of this simultaneous processing of multiple meanings, rather than an abandonment to liberal pluralisms and tolerant (or intolerant) relativisms. This is not a book about "method", but it does propose a dialectic capable of holding together in one breath the heterogeneities that reflect our biological individualities, our submersion in collective history and class struggle, and our alienation to a disembodied new world of information and abstraction. Eschewing the arid secularities of philosophy, Walter Benjamin once recommended the alternative of the rich figurality of an older theology; in that spirit we here return to the antiquated Ptolemaic systems of ancient allegory and its multiple levels (a proposal first sketched out in The Political Unconscious); it is tested against the epic complexities of the overtly allegorical works of Dante, Spenser and the Goethe of Faust II, as well as symphonic form in music, and the structure of the novel, postmodern as well as Third-World: about which a notorious essay on National Allegory is here reprinted with a theoretical commentary; and an allegorical history of emotion is meanwhile rehearsed from its contemporary, geopolitical context.</p><p><b>Fredric Jameson</b> is Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature at Duke University.

Feist, Terry Pratchett, Charles de Lint, George R. R. Martin, and more</h2><p>NOMINATED FOR THE 2002 HUGO AND LOCUS AWARD<br><br>When J.R.R. Tolkien created the extraordinary world of Middle-earth and populated it with fantastic, archetypal denizens, reinventing the heroic quest, the world hardly noticed. Sales of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> languished for the better part of two decades, until the Ballantine editions were published here in America. By late 1950s, however, the books were selling well and beginning to change the face of fantasy. . . . forever.<br><br>A generation of students and aspiring writers had their hearts and imaginations captured by the rich tapestry of the Middle-earth mythos, the larger-than-life heroic characters, the extraordinary and exquisite nature of Tolkien's prose, and the unending quest to balance evil with good. These young readers grew up to become the successful writers of modern fantasy. They created their own worlds and universes, in some cases their own languages, and their own epic heroic quests. And all of them owe a debt of gratitude to the works and the author who first set them on the path.<br><br><i>In Meditations on Middle-earth</i>, sixteen bestselling fantasy authors share details of their personal relationships with Tolkien's mythos, for it inspired them all. Had there been no <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, there would also have been no <i>Earthsea</i> books by Ursula K. Le Guin; no <i>Song of Ice and Fire</i> saga from George R. R. Martin; no <i>Tales of Discworld</i> from Terry Pratchett; no <i>Legends of Alvin Maker</i> from Orson Scott Card. Each of them was influenced by the master mythmaker, and now each reveals the nature of that influence and their personal relationships with the greatest fantasy novels ever written in the English language.<br><br>If you've never read the Tolkien books, read these essays and discover the depthy and beauty of his work. If you are a fan of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, the candid comments of these modern mythmakers will give you new insight into the subtlety, power, and majesty of Tolkien's tales and how he told them.&nbsp;<i>Meditations on Middle-Earth</i> is a 2002 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Related Work.</p><p>If you remember where you were when you first read <i>The Hobbit</i> or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, then this collection of essays by some of fantasy and science fiction's most popular authors is worth a look. J.R.R. Tolkien's impact on fantastic fiction--and its writers--is explored in contributions that range from intensely personal expressions of the power and beauty of Tolkien's work to more analytical examinations of his style, language, and influences. <p> Standouts include Michael Swanwick's thoughtful and powerful meditation on heroism and consequences; Ursula K. Le Guin's analysis of narrative rhythm and language in the trilogy; Terri Windling's moving reflection on an escape from abuse fueled by the power of fairy tales; and Douglas A. Anderson's examination of the critical response to Tolkien's work. </p><p> This is an uneven collection, with a couple of downright clunkers, but it should appeal to Tolkien aficionados who are interested in the master's influence on those working in the field today. <i>--Roz Genessee</i></p>Karen Haber is the art book reviewer for <i>Locus</i>, and profiles artists for both <i>Realms of Fantasy</i> and <i>Galaxyonline</i>.

In a preface, Sis makes refer ence to Columbus escaping the walls of fear and ignorance that encompassed 15th-century Europe and uses that mo tif freely throughout--as a curtain framing a view of Genoa, a background for pictures of Columbus's early life, and in an endpaper map of Europe sur rounded by a wall. The illustrations, ex ecuted in a variety of media--oil, ink, watercolor, and gouache--show scenes from the explorer's life as well as some of the many imaginary creatures that populated the Europeans' picture of the outside world at that time. Sis uses col ors ranging from drab browns and grays, to a rose-colored sky that is a background for the king and queen of Spain, and deep blues and greens for the ocean. A double-page medieval- style map is bordered with important dates and small pictures representing those dates, while another double page shows many postage-stamp-size repre sentations of the sea as described in Co lumbus's log.

Beginning in his home territory of southwest Scotland, Goldsworthy traces the ancient routes along which sheep were once driven over the border to markets in England, building, dismantling, and rebuilding along the way a red standstone arch.<br>Goldsworthy's color photographs record the arch's progress southward, as it is constructed, often in the evening, and taken down early in the morning in a rich variety of locations: on the site of a vanished stone sheep pen in a town center, on land high above a six-lane highway, and half-in and half-out of a stream.<br>While Andy Goldsworthy lives close to the start of the arch's route, writer David Craig lives near its end. Craig shares with Goldsworthy a deep concern with the history of the land, and his text touches both on its ancient geological origins and on the lives of the people who have lived and worked on it over the centuries. All those interested in Goldsworthy's work will appreciate Craig's evocative account of the arch's travels and its reception in the various communities through which it passes.</p><p>Tour the English countryside with artist Andy Goldsworthy and writer David Craig, as they trace an ancient drover's route from the sheep pastures of Thornhill, Scotland, to the old market town of Kirkby Lonsdale, England. Goldsworthy, whose natural sculptures are often made up of collections of carefully arranged rocks, has created a self-supporting arch that is assembled with about 30 stones and no mortar. As he and Craig travel the British countryside, they set up and photograph the red sandstone arch in a wide variety of locations. Some sites have changed little over the centuries--on a number of occasions they erect the sculpture in original sheep folds (corrals). In other cases, the arch marks the changing landscape, as in Shap, Cumbria, where it was assembled on a sidewalk across from a relatively new school building.<p> Documenting this exploration, <i>Arch</i> includes 35 beautiful photographs as well as a poetic day journal written by Craig describing the journey. Looking at the different sites where the arch stood and reading Craig's insight into the geography and history of the land provides a unique opportunity for readers to experience Goldsworthy's work and England's natural history in one sitting. <i>--Loren E.

The bean plant transports her to a tropical rainforest, then is moved to a large pot on the balcony; the cricket carries Juna over city buildings to the window of Hector s bedroom, where his stone-filled kimchi jar sits on a windowsill near his bed.

When Hector moves away, Juna's older brother, Minho, observing her sadness, buys her a small fish, gives her a small bean plant grown at school, then helps her find twigs and leaves in the park to provide a habitat for a cricket. Each night, the kimchi jar takes Juna on a fabulous journey. The goldfish takes her on an undersea adventure, growing so large that it must be transferred to the family aquarium. The bean plant transports her to a tropical rainforest, then is moved to a large pot on the balcony; the cricket carries Juna over city buildings to the window of Hector's bedroom, where his stone-filled kimchi jar sits on a windowsill near his bed. Seeing Hector safe and happy allows Juna to move on and make a new friend at the park. Hoshino's delightful detail-filled paintings of Juna's nighttime adventures show smiling sea creatures, sloths, monkeys and crocodiles, and a city alive with activity, illuminated by vehicle headlights "that lit up the hill like a string of holiday lights."

They don&#x2019;t stem from a lack of knowledge or a failure of will. Instead, they are a product of subconscious beliefs and thought patterns, rooted in our childhoods, that are so deeply ingrained in us, they shape the way we deal with money our entire adult lives.

By looking deep into ourselves and our pasts, we can learn to recognize these negative and self-defeating patterns of thinking, and replace them with better, healthier ones. <br><br>Drawing on their decades of experience helping patients resolve their troubling issues with money, the Klontzes and describe the twelve most common &#x201c;money disorders&#x201d; - like financial infidelity, money avoidance, compulsive shopping, financial enabling, and more &#x2014; and explain how we can learn to identify them, understand their root causes, and ultimately overcome them. <br><br>So whether you want to learn how to make better financial decision, have more open communication with your spouse or kids about the family finances, or simply be better equipped to deal with the challenges of these tough economic times, this book will help you repair your dysfunctional relationship with money and live a healthier financial life.</p><p>DRS. BRAD AND TED KLONTZ, father and son pioneers in the emerging field of financial psychology, are president and CEO of Klontz Coaching and Consulting and co-founders of Your Mental Wealth &#x2122; . In addition to their clinical work, they speak to audiences over 70 times a year about issues relating to behavioral finance, money disorders, and financial health. The author of several books and countless articles, they are frequently quoted in the media about issues relating to behavioral finance, money disorders, and financial health, including the Wall Street Journal, CNN, Good Morning America, The Today Show, The New York Times, and Money Magazine.The authors&#39; guide to personal finance disorders outlines 12 common scripts-feelings and values we learn in early life-that subconsciously keep us from managing money in a healthy way. The scripts are grouped into three clusters: avoidance, excess, and relationship-based malfunctions. Vivid case studies blend seamlessly into the smooth flow of useful ideas. The presentation is less about what to do than about why many of us don&#39;t make money choices that are more respectful of our healthiest priorities and expectations. The younger member of this father-son team of financial psychologists narrates. Though he sounds a bit weak at first, his sincerity and absence of judgment become the dominant features of the listening experience.

But the seeds they plant bloom in tragic ways within this complex culture. Set against one of the most dramatic political events of the twentieth century -- the Congo's fight for independence from Belgium and its devastating consequences -- here is <em>New York Times</em>-bestselling author Barbara Kingslover's beautiful, heartbreaking, and unforgettable epic that chronicles the disintegration of family and a nation.</p></p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, June 2000:</b> As any reader of <i>The Mosquito Coast</i> knows, men who drag their families to far-off climes in pursuit of an Idea seldom come to any good, while those familiar with <i>At Play in the Fields of the Lord</i> or <i>Kalimantaan</i> understand that the minute a missionary sets foot on the fictional stage, all hell is about to break loose. So when Barbara Kingsolver sends missionary Nathan Price along with his wife and four daughters off to Africa in <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i>, you can be sure that salvation is the one thing they're not likely to find. The year is 1959 and the place is the Belgian Congo. Nathan, a Baptist preacher, has come to spread the Word in a remote village reachable only by airplane. To say that he and his family are woefully unprepared would be an understatement: "We came from Bethlehem, Georgia, bearing Betty Crocker cake mixes into the jungle," says Leah, one of Nathan's daughters. But of course it isn't long before they discover that the tremendous humidity has rendered the mixes unusable, their clothes are unsuitable, and they've arrived in the middle of political upheaval as the Congolese seek to wrest independence from Belgium. In addition to poisonous snakes, dangerous animals, and the hostility of the villagers to Nathan's fiery take-no-prisoners brand of Christianity, there are also rebels in the jungle and the threat of war in the air. Could things get any worse? <p> In fact they can and they do. The first part of <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i> revolves around Nathan's intransigent, bullying personality and his effect on both his family and the village they have come to. As political instability grows in the Congo, so does the local witch doctor's animus toward the Prices, and both seem to converge with tragic consequences about halfway through the novel. From that point on, the family is dispersed and the novel follows each member's fortune across a span of more than 30 years. </p><p> <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i> is arguably Barbara Kingsolver's most ambitious work, and it reveals both her great strengths and her weaknesses. As Nathan Price's wife and daughters tell their stories in alternating chapters, Kingsolver does a good job of differentiating the voices. But at times they can grate--teenage Rachel's tendency towards precious malapropisms is particularly annoying (students practice their "French congregations"; Nathan's refusal to take his family home is a "tapestry of justice"). More problematic is Kingsolver's tendency to wear her politics on her sleeve; this is particularly evident in the second half of the novel, in which she uses her characters as mouthpieces to explicate the complicated and tragic history of the Belgian Congo. </p><p> Despite these weaknesses, Kingsolver's fully realized, three-dimensional characters make <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i> compelling, especially in the first half, when Nathan Price is still at the center of the action. And in her treatment of Africa and the Africans she is at her best, exhibiting the acute perception, moral engagement, and lyrical prose that have made her previous novels so successful. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"The Poisonwood Bible" is a story told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it--from garden seeds to Scripture--is calamitously transformed on African soil. What follows is a suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa. <p>The novel is set against one of the most dramatic political chronicles of the twentieth century: the Congo's fight for independence from Belgium, the murder of its first elected prime minister, the CIA coup to install his replacement, and the insidious progress of a world economic order that robs the fledgling African nation of its autonomy. Against this backdrop, Orleanna Price reconstructs the story of her evangelist husband's part in the Western assault on Africa, a tale indelibly darkened by her own losses and unanswerable questions about her own culpability. Also narrating the story, by turns, are her four daughters--the self-centered, teenaged Rachel; shrewd adolescent twins Leah and Adah; and Ruth May, a prescient five-year-old. These sharply observant girls, who arrive in the Congo with racial preconceptions forged in 1950s Georgia, will be marked in surprisingly different ways by their father's intractable mission, and by Africa itself. Ultimately each must strike her own separate path to salvation. Their passionately intertwined stories become a compelling exploration of moral risk and personal responsibility. </p><p>Dancing between the dark comedy of human failings and thebreathtaking possibilities of human hope, "The Poisonwood Bible" possesses all that has distinguished Barbara Kingsolver's previous work, and extends this beloved writer's vision to an entirely new level. Taking its place alongside the classic works of postcolonial literature, this ambitious novel establishes Kingsolver as one of the most thoughtful and daring of modern writers.</p></p><h2>Nightworld</h2><p>As the days grow shorter and the nights longer and scientists scramble for answers, terror spreads throughout the world and an ancient evil prepares to be reborn. Original.</p><p><p>F. PAUL WILSON, the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author and winner of the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement, lives in New Jersey.</p><b>WEDNESDAY</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Nicholas Quinn, Ph.D.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Manhattan</b><br>On May 17, the sun rose late.<br>Nick Quinn heard the first vague rumors of a delayed sunrise while filling his coffee mug from the urn in the lounge of Columbia University&#x2019;s physics department. He didn&#x2019;t pay them much mind. A screwed-up calculation, a missed observation, a malfunctioning clock. Human error. Had to be. Old Sol never missed appointments. It simply didn&#x2019;t happen.<br>But the rumor continued to echo through the halls all morning, with no offsetting rumor of explanation. So at lunch break, when Nick had settled his usual roast beef on rye and large cola on his tray in the faculty cafeteria, the first thing he did was hunt up Harvey Sapir from astrophysics.<br>Nick looked for the hair. Harv&#x2019;s hair was always perfect. It flowed back seamlessly from his forehead in a salt-and-pepper wave, so full and thick it looked like a toupee. Close up, if you looked carefully, you could catch a glimpse of pink scalp through the mane. A running joke around the physics department was guesstimating how much time and spray Harv invested in his hair each morning.<br>Nick spotted him at a corner table with Cynthia Hayes. She was from astrophysics too. The two of them were in deep conversation.<br>Harv&#x2019;s hair was a mess.<br>Nick found that unsettling.<br>&#x201c;Mind if I join you?&#x201d; he said, hovering over the seat next to Cynthia.<br>Both glanced up and nodded absently, then immediately put their heads back together.<br>Beneath his uncombed hair, Harv&#x2019;s face was haggard. He looked all of his fifty-five years and then some. Cynthia too looked disheveled. She was younger&#x2014;mid thirties&#x2014;with short chestnut hair and glorious skin. Nick liked her. A lot. She was the main reason he&#x2019;d put aside his Coke-bottle lenses and got fitted for contacts. Years ago. Still hadn&#x2019;t found the nerve to ask her out. With his pocked skin and weird-shaped head, he felt like a warty frog with no chance of ever changing into a prince, yet still he pined for this princess.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s all this I hear about the sun being late?&#x201d; he said after swallowing the first bite of his sandwich. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d a story like that get started?&#x201d;<br>They both glanced at him again, then Cynthia leaned back and rubbed her eyes.<br>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s true.&#x201d;<br>Nick stopped in mid bite and stared at them, looking for a smile, a twist of the lips, a hint of the put-on.<br>Nothing. Two deadpan faces.<br>&#x201c;Bullshit.&#x201d;<br>Instantly he regretted it. He never used profanity in front of a woman, even though many of them had no reservations about swearing like sailors in front of him.<br>&#x201c;Sunrise was scheduled at five twenty-one this morning,&#x201d; Cynthia said. &#x201c;It rose at five twenty-six. Five minutes and eight-point-two-two seconds late.&#x201d;<br>Her husky voice never failed to give him a warm feeling.<br>Except today. Her words chilled him. She was saying the unthinkable.<br>&#x201c;Come on, guys.&#x201d; He forced a laugh. &#x201c;We set our clocks by the sun, not vice versa. If the clock says the sun is late, then the clock needs to be reset.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<i>Atomic</i> clocks, Nick?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;<br>That was different. Atomic clocks worked on nuclear decay. They were accurate to a millionth of a second. If they said the sun was late&nbsp;...<br>&#x201c;Could be some sort of mechanical failure.&#x201d;<br>Harv shook his head. &#x201c;Greenwich reported a late rise too. Five minutes and a fraction late. They called us. I was here at four thirty A.M., waiting. As Cynthia told you, sunrise was late here by exactly the same interval.&#x201d;<br>Nick felt a worm of uneasiness begin to work its way up his spine.<br>&#x201c;What about Palo Alto?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The same,&#x201d; Cynthia said.<br>&#x201c;But do you know what you&#x2019;re saying? Do you know what this means?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course I know what it means!&#x201d; Harv said with ill-concealed annoyance. &#x201c;This <i>is</i> my field, you know. It means the earth has either temporarily slowed its rate of spin during the night or tilted back on its axis.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But either would mean cataclysm! Why, the effect on tides alone would be&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But it <i>didn&#x2019;t</i> slow. Not the slightest variation in axial rotation <i>or</i> axial tilt. Believe me, I&#x2019;ve checked. The days are supposed to be getting progressively longer until the equinox in June, but today got shorter&#x2014;or at least it started out that way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then the clocks are wrong!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Atomic clocks? <i>All</i> of them? All experiencing precisely the same level of change in nuclear decay at the same time? I doubt it. No, Nick. The sun rose late this morning.&#x201d;<br>Nick&#x2019;s field was lasers and particle physics. He was used to uncertainties at the subatomic level&#x2014;Heisenberg had seen to that. But on the celestial plane, things were supposed to go like&nbsp;... clockwork.<br>&#x201c;This is all <i>impossible</i>!&#x201d;<br>Harv&#x2019;s expression was desolate, Cynthia&#x2019;s frightened.<br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he said in a low voice. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I know.&#x201d;<br>And then Nick remembered a conversation he&#x2019;d had with a certain Jesuit a couple of months ago.<br><i>It will begin in the heavens</i>&nbsp;...<br>After years of hiding in the South, Father Bill Ryan had returned to the city, but was still lying low. Only a handful of people knew he was back. After all, he was still wanted by the police.<br>Poor Father Bill. The years of seclusion had not been kind to him. He looked so much older, and he acted strange. Simultaneously jumpy, irritable, frightened, and angry. And he talked of strange things. No specifics, just cryptic warnings of some sort of approaching Armageddon. Nothing involving Islamic crazies. Something else&nbsp;...<br>One thing Father Bill had been fairly positive about was where it all would start.<br><i>It will begin in the heavens.</i><br>He&#x2019;d told Nick to keep his ears open and to let him know if he heard of anything strange happening in the skies, no matter how insignificant.<br>Well, something more than strange had happened. Something far from insignificant. Something impossible.<br><i>It will begin in the heavens.</i><br>The unease in Nick&#x2019;s spine stopped crawling and sprinted up to the back of his neck, spreading across his shoulders. He excused himself from the table and pulled out his cell phone as he headed for the hallway.<br><b>William Ryan, S.J.</b><br>&#x201c;Ask him about tonight,&#x201d; Glaeken said, close by Bill&#x2019;s side. &#x201c;Do they think the sun will set <i>ahead</i> of schedule tonight?&#x201d;<br>Bill turned back to the phone and repeated the question. Nick&#x2019;s reply was agitated. Bill detected a tremor weaving through the younger man&#x2019;s voice.<br><i>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, and I&#x2019;m sure Harv and Cynthia don&#x2019;t know, either. This is terra incognita, Bill. Nothing like this has ever happened before. All bets are off.&#x201d;</i><br>&#x201c;Okay, Nick. Thanks for calling. Keep me posted, will you? Let me know about sunset.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;</i> Nick said. <i>&#x201c;Keep you posted? What&#x2019;s this all about? How did you know something was going to happen? What&#x2019;s it all mean?&#x201d;</i><br>Bill sensed the fear, the uncharacteristic uncertainty in Nick, and wished he could say something to comfort him. But Bill had nothing comforting to say.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll know as soon as I know. I promise you. Get back to me here tonight. I&#x2019;ll be waiting for you. Good-bye.&#x201d;<br>Bill hung up and turned to Glaeken, but the old man was over by the picture window, staring down at the park. He did that a lot.<br>Glaeken looked eighty-something, maybe ninety, with white hair and wrinkled olive skin; blue eyes shone above high cheekbones. Though slightly stooped, he was still a big man, and his frame blocked a good portion of the window. Bill had been living here in Glaeken&#x2019;s apartment building for the past couple of months, helping him with his ailing wife, driving him around town while he did his &#x201c;research,&#x201d; but mostly waiting.<br>A huge apartment, occupying the entire top floor of the building, filled with strange curios and even stranger paintings. The wall to Bill&#x2019;s left was mirrored and he started at the stranger facing him in the glass, then realized he was looking at himself. He&#x2019;d shaved his beard and cut his hair. He missed his ponytail and still wasn&#x2019;t used to seeing himself with bare cheeks. Or looking so old. The hair had been gray for years, but the beard had hidden all the lines in his face.<br>He moved up to the window and stood beside Glaeken.<br>The months of waiting since March were apparently over. In a way he was glad for that. But an icy tendril of dread slithered through his gut as he realized he had traded one uncertainty for another. The apprehension of wondering <i>when</i> it would start had been replaced now by a greater worry of <i>what</i> was starting.<br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t seem too surprised,&#x201d; Bill said.<br>&#x201c;I sensed the difference this morning. Your friend confirmed it. The Change has begun its march.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t know it from the looks of things down there.&#x201d;<br>Across the street and a dozen stories below, the high spring sun spread a palette of greens across Central Park as the various species of trees sprouted this year&#x2019;s leaf crop.<br>&#x201c;No. And you won&#x2019;t for a while. But now we must lower our watch. The next manifestation will occur in the earth.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Like what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. But if he follows his pattern, that is where he&#x2019;ll make his next move. And when he has reached his full powers&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You mean he <i>hasn&#x2019;t</i>?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He must go through a process before his power is complete.

The question struck home. Laurino was exploring the governor&#39;s ethnic roots, yet only a few years earlier she had contemplated chopping the vowels off the end of her name. Mixing memoir, social and cultural history, and reporting, Laurino sifts through the stereotypes bedeviling Italian-Americans. With a sympathetic but clear eye, she writes about guidos, bimbettes, and mammoni (mama&#39;s boys in Italy). She examines the clashing aesthetics of Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace, and unravels the etymology of southern Italian dialect words like gavone or bubidabetz. And, careful to avoid the perils of nostalgia, she explores the pungent influence on her life of ancestral Italian attitudes towards family, work, and faith. Warmly personal and cleverly objective, Laurino&#39;s work is surprising on every page. It is both a celebration of a group often overlooked in literature and a long-overdue critique of romanticized ideas of &#34;ethnicity&#34;--a book that should appeal to the children and grandchildren of every immigrant to America.</p><p>Maria Laurino is a journalist and essayist living in New York City. Her work has appeared in numerous publications including the New York Times and the Village Voice.Three generations in America doesn't necessarily take the sting out of being an immigrant, as described in this appealing and sometimes thought-provoking memoir that moves from suburban New Jersey to Italy's southern provinces. The title question was posed by former New York governor Mario Cuomo as journalist Laurino was interviewing him on his own roots. Laurino's honest answer was no, as she recalls her adolescent efforts to distance herself from her Italian heritage. They began in earnest when a classmate characterized her as the smelly Italian girl: assured by friends that she did not have an odor, Laurino nevertheless began to understand that, despite her wardrobe from Saks, her darker skin and the vowels at the end of her name put her on a lower rung of the social ladder than the WASPs or JAPs who were the popular cliques at her high school. Broadening her perspective, Laurino examines the stereotyping of Italian-Americans via Mafia movies and a visit to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst (where gold-chained guidos and big-haired guidettes mark one very visible end of Italian-American rankings). Laurino blends personal experience and academic research in examining class bigotries not only in America, but also in Rome and Milan (where she found the northern Italian contempt for southern Italians as powerful as the prejudice against African-Americans in the US). When she and her husband finally visit what is left of the family in southern Italy (on the ankle of the boot), she finds them poor, hardworking, and closely knit, as they were when her grandparents sailed for America. Their habits and concerns resemble those of Laurino's mother (in her work rituals, for example, or in her inclination to hoard any luxury), leading the author to speculate that her own tendency to hoard may have been born in the fields of abject poverty. Other hyphenated Americans who have experienced discrimination and confusion about their heritage will find this often funny and graceful book simpatico. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

DISOBEYING THE LAW<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>I. Underhanded Practices</i><br>One night in November 1938, a fourteen-year-old boy named Erich Billig slipped across the Austrian border into Switzerland. It was, he hoped, the final leg of a hastily arranged journey that had begun ten days earlier, on November 9&#x2013;10, when Billig and Jews throughout Vienna hid in their apartments or ducked for cover while Nazi storm troopers led a bloody rampage through the streets. In the organized pogrom known as Kristallnacht, which turned Austria&#x2019;s stately capital into a cauldron of terror and violence, hundreds of Jewish shops were vandalized, dozens of temples burned down, and scores of injuries and fatalities recorded. The shattered storefronts and smoldering synagogues left little doubt what the unification of Austria and Germany, which Adolf Hitler had announced before cheering throngs of jubilant supporters in Vienna&#x2019;s Heldenplatz (&#x201c;Heroes&#x2019; Square&#x201d;) in March, would mean for Jews. Erich Billig already had a sense. A few months earlier his father had been deported to Dachau, a concentration camp near Munich; his older brother, Herbert, had fled the country after landing on the Gestapo&#x2019;s wanted list, and was now in Zurich. After Kristallnacht, Billig&#x2019;s mother, Hilde, put her youngest son on a train bound for Altach, a town near the Swiss border, where he holed up in an abandoned shed and pondered how to get to Zurich himself.<br>There was one problem: Switzerland, like every other country in the world, didn&#x2019;t want to take in masses of Jewish refugees. At the Evian Conference, held at the Hotel Royal on the shores of Lake Geneva in July that same year, representatives from thirty-two countries had gathered to discuss the plight of Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. Expressions of sympathy rained down from the dignitaries; promises to take in more refugees did not. Unlike some countries, including the United States, Switzerland did not have a fixed quota limiting immigration on the basis of nationality. It did have a statute requiring Austrian refugees to secure an entry visa beforehand, which the Swiss consulate in Vienna had been directed to grant only to applicants of &#x201c;Aryan&#x201d; ancestry.<br>Lacking the proper lineage, Billig staked his hopes on finding a more discreet path across the border. One night, he and two other Jews he met in Altach entrusted their fate to an Austrian gendarme who claimed to know of such a route. After pocketing the money they&#x2019;d pooled, the gendarme led them through a forest to a clearing bordered by a shallow creek, a place known to the villagers on the other side of the border as <i>le vieux Rhin</i>. Here, for a brief stretch, the great river that flowed down from the Alps and snaked its way along the Swiss-Austrian border before emptying into Lake Constance tapered off into a narrow, easily passable stream. The gendarme motioned toward it and said, &#x201c;Okay, there&#x2019;s the border. Now you can go to the other side.&#x201d;<br>The trio of fugitives waded across the knee-high water and followed a footpath into an open field, moving soundlessly along what they thought was an unobstructed path. They hadn&#x2019;t gone far before the sound of dogs barking pierced the silence, tipping off the guards on duty that night.<br>Hours later, as morning light filtered through the alder trees and spread over the hills and meadows of the neighboring villages, the Swiss authorities confirmed that Billig lacked an entry visa and sent him back to Austria.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Three months before Erich Billig&#x2019;s thwarted expedition, the chiefs of police from the cantons of Switzerland were summoned to attend a conference on immigration in Bern, the Swiss capital. It took place on August 17, 1938, during a spell of glorious weather, a string of cloudless days ideal for leisurely strolls along the banks of the Aare River, which looped around the peninsula on which Bern&#x2019;s cobbled streets and medieval-style buildings were spread out.<br>The officials at the conference gathered inside the Bundeshaus, a domed edifice set on a promontory where Heinrich Rothmund, head of the Federal Police for Foreigners, held forth. A tall man with a clean-shaven jaw and neatly trimmed mustache, Rothmund was responsible for refugee policy in a country that had long prided itself on its hospitality to strangers, a tradition dating back to the Protestant Reformation, when French Huguenots had settled in Geneva to escape religious persecution. In more recent times, Switzerland had burnished its reputation for neutrality in part by offering shelter to the victims of conflict in bordering states. Rothmund was not unaware of this heritage. &#x201c;The asylum tradition of our country is so firmly anchored that not only the Swiss citizen but every office that must deal with an individual refugee case is inclined to accept the person without reservations,&#x201d; he observed at one point. But his tolerance was hedged by other concerns. One of these concerns was <i>�berfremdung</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;foreign overpopulation,&#x201d; an expression that cropped up with growing frequency as the Great Depression fueled anxiety among Swiss citizens that foreigners might take their jobs. Another was <i>Verujudung</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;Jewification,&#x201d; which Rothmund, among others, portrayed as a virus that could produce unwelcome side effects if allowed to metastasize and spread. &#x201c;If we do not want to let a movement that is anti-Semitic and unworthy of our country take legitimate roots here, then we need to fend off the immigration of foreign Jews with all our power,&#x201d; Rothmund warned. &#x201c;We have not used the foreign registration office to oppose foreign penetration, particularly the Jewification of Switzerland, just to let ourselves be flooded by immigrants today.&#x201d;<br>As the statement suggests, the custom of welcoming strangers gave way to other priorities as the political skies darkened over Europe during the 1930s, all the more so when Jews began spilling over the Swiss border in unprecedented numbers after Germany&#x2019;s annexation of Austria in March 1938. In the months that followed, even refugees with work permits were picked up in Switzerland for &#x201c;looking Jewish&#x201d; and sent back. Yet more and more kept coming, driven by desperate circumstances that, in Bern, elicited little sympathy from the officials on hand. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we close our borders better?&#x201d; asked the chief of police from Zurich during the conference. They certainly spared no effort to try. To make it easier to pick out and identify &#x201c;non-Aryan&#x201d; refugees, the Swiss authorities soon prodded Germany to place a special mark on the papers of Jews, a request the Nazis obliged by stamping their passports with a large red <i>J</i>. Meanwhile, under the new policy unanimously adopted at the conference organized by Heinrich Rothmund, anyone who crossed the Swiss border without proper papers after August 19, 1938, was to be denied entry &#x201c;without exception.&#x201d;<br>The policy of no exceptions is what prevented Erich Billig from being welcomed after he&#x2019;d been caught sneaking across the Rhine. It did not prevent Billig from trying again, the very next night, with the help of two Swiss guides who distracted the border guards as he forded the river a second time, then spirited him to a secluded bungalow where he ate, slept, and spread his waterlogged shoes and clothes over a stove to dry. The following morning, Billig squeezed into the back of a truck belonging to the guides, who drew a canvas tarp over him and drove to the city of St. Gallen, twenty miles or so inside Switzerland. They pulled to a stop in front of a building by a church near the center of town, the headquarters of a Jewish relief agency. Billig climbed out of the truck and was taken inside to meet the agency&#x2019;s director, a dapper, bespectacled man named Sidney Dreifuss. Shortly thereafter, an official appeared, dressed in a crisp police uniform and wearing a rimless pince-nez held in place by a thin metal chain tucked behind a pair of ear pads. Billig had never seen such a contraption before and he would not soon forget it, not least because, after interrogating him for several minutes and taking stock of his options, the officer with the peculiar ear pads told him that he could stay.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Paul Gr�ninger was the commander of the state police in St. Gallen, which is situated in northeast Switzerland, on a plateau between the shores of Lake Constance and the snowcapped peaks of the Appenzell Mountains, the northernmost range of the Alps. He was forty-seven years old at the time he met Erich Billig in the Jewish relief agency, a pale, unprepossessing man with gray-green eyes, pursed lips, and a background bereft of obvious clues as to why he would have put his career at risk by violating the policy formulated at the conference on immigration in Bern, which he&#x2019;d attended.<br>Born in 1891, Gr�ninger was the son of middle-class merchants who ran a small cigar shop in St. Gallen. As a youth, he was a mediocre student but precocious athlete whose proudest accomplishments came not in the classroom but on the soccer field (he would later play on a team that won the Swiss national cup). During World War I, he served in the Swiss Army. Some time later, in 1919, an influential client dropped by his parents&#x2019; cigar shop and tipped them off that the police in St. Gallen had a vacancy and would soon be looking to hire a lieutenant, a position ideal for a young man of military rank. By this point, Gr�ninger had obtained a teaching diploma and moved to the neighboring town of Au, where he&#x2019;d joined the staff of a primary school and met Alice Federer, a colleague to whom he&#x2019;d gotten engaged. Alice didn&#x2019;t want to live in St. Gallen, but at the urging of his mother, Gr�ninger applied for the opening in the police department and beat out seventy other candidates for the post.<br>Shortly after they&#x2019;d set...</p><h2>The Dunwich Horror and Others</h2><p>Chilling experiences in the supernatural world are revealed in detail in sixteen macabre tales</p><p>Alan Judd began writing while in the Foreign Office.

His last novel was Legacy, a thriller set in 1970s London. Judd is the motoring correspondent of the Spectator and writes regularly for the Daily Telegraph.The Exception <br> <br>ONE<br> <br>The Kaiser was chopping logs. In the summer air his strokes echoed through the trees, across the park and gardens and into Huis Doorn itself, where those of the household would be listening. So long as they could hear him, they would know that all was well with their �Kaiser that morning. They could relax, he thought, and be happy, or busy about their work, which was to his mind the same thing.<br> <br>His strokes were regular but the pauses were longer now. At eighty, it was an achievement to split a log at all&#x2014;to see it, even&#x2014;let alone do it daily. Nearly every day since his exile in 1918 he had chopped or sawn. At first he had imagined the logs his enemies, the poltroons who had betrayed him and urged him to flee so that they could grab power for themselves. Gradually, he had ceased to care about that bunch of pigs but had continued felling because it made him feel better, restoring his sense of achievement. Twenty thousand trees felled in the first eleven years of exile; that was something. Since then another twelve years during which he had not kept such meticulous records; not quite another twenty thousand, perhaps, but still a good number. His best was 2,590 in one week&#x2014;Christmas week&#x2014;after he had moved here to Doorn after Amerongen, the other Dutch place. What would the Englishman, Gladstone, another elderly tree feller, have said to that? It might have silenced him, and his tribe. Tree feller, tree fella, it punned in English. He would entertain people with it.<br> <br>Bismarck would have had something to say to it, of course. He was a tree lover who used to try to plant a tree for every one that Gladstone felled and then write to him about it, to boast. Well now, he, Wilhelm II, had bested them both, because he had felled more and planted more than either.<br> <br>Bismarck had something to say to everything; that was his trouble. That was why it was right to get rid of him all those years ago, to drop the pilot, as someone put it. It was right then, anyway. Perhaps he might not have made the same decision now. But that was then, when everything was different. When you are young you do not understand how different then and now are because you have lived only in now and it feels as if that is where you will always live. You do not realize that your now&#x2014;and you&#x2014;are becoming then. And when you realize how completely now has become then, how different it is, it is like the fall of the ax. It splits you off from all these younger people who, however much they think they know or understand, cannot feel life as it was then. The pulse of it; that was the thing, always, with everything, and that is what cannot be conveyed.<br> <br>The Kaiser swung the ax again but this time it bounced violently, jarring his arm as if the log&#x2014;oak, it looked like&#x2014;were stone. It was a knotted old log, cross-grained, compacted, irreducible. He blamed Bismarck because he had been thinking of rum. Even from his grave that cross-grained old man with the soul of a Pomeranian tenant farmer still had the power to interpose himself wherever you looked, to make everything awkward, to turn things into problems which only he could solve. They were barely more than peasants, those Bismarcks, all of them. Their servants pulled wine corks with the bottles between their knees in front of you and there were always dogs around the table. The old man fed the dogs from his dinner plate, holding it while they licked it. Perhaps it was the very plate that he himself, the Kaiser, might have eaten from next time. That was a metaphor: Bismarck really cared more for his dog than for his Kaiser.<br> <br>The Kaiser lowered his ax to the ground and, using the shaft as a prop, carefully lifted one foot. With the hard toe of his boot he nudged the knotted log off the chopping block, a massive section of beech trunk. Then he let go of the ax and stooped to pick up another log. It was hard with one hand because the log was too wide to grip and he had to roll it up the side of the beech trunk. When he was younger he might have exercised his left arm by trying to ease the log into a central position on the block, but he didn&#x2019;t bother much with that arm now. A withered, blighted thing, from birth three inches shorter than its mate, he could hold with it but not lift or push much. God and he alone knew the youthful effort it cost him to learn to ride and to shoot, to learn above all not to be handicapped by this handicap. God had given it to him to make him tough, he had long ago decided. Years of solitary practice, holding oars out straight, had made his good right arm stronger than most men&#x2019;s two arms, with a grip that had been compared to that of John Sullivan, the boxing champion. But even John Sullivan was then. Who spoke of him now?<br> <br>The ax split the new log clean, with a crack that echoed through the trees around the woodshed. Most men could not swing an ax with two arms as he still swung with one. There were plenty of trees ready for felling, more than he had days.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your Highness! Your Royal Highness!&#x201d;<br> <br>The Kaiser leant on his ax, turning slowly. The new Dutch maid was running through the rough grass bordering the park and the trees, clutching her white apron in one hand and waving with the other. When she called again he realized he had heard her before swinging at that last log but had not registered it. That happened, nowadays. He waited. He had heard and uttered many urgent summonses in life but now, robbed of their temporary urgency, it was clear that the things that would happen, happened, whether or not you buzzed about like a demented bluebottle. These days, he felt, there was nothing left to be urgent about. What would come would come soon enough, in its own time, and until then one chopped wood and shrugged one&#x2019;s shoulders at the world. He would not be hurried.<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;Highness!&#x201d;<br> <br>She almost stumbled in the last few yards. She was called Akki, his wife had told him. Breathlessness made her prettier than ever. A wisp of dark hair had come adrift from her bun and her smooth cheeks were colored. Such beautiful skin, almost olive; he always wanted to touch it. Her gray eyes were quiet and thoughtful, cold as a March wind. Yet it was her hands above all that he looked for, slender, white, quick, full of energy but composed and controlled. With him it had always been the hands. First his mother&#x2019;s, then those of her friends and then&#x2014;well, as many as he could get, in his youth. Beloved Dona, his first wife, she had good hands, but she knew what hands meant to him and throughout their marriage had ensured that all female servants had hands either like chicken claws or overgrown potatoes. She would never have permitted Akki to join the household. But Hermo, his new wife, did not know about this thing of his.<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;Highness!&#x201d; The girl stood panting before him, her gray eyes widened, one hand still clutching her apron. &#x201c;Highness, they have come. The Germans. They are here. Princess Hermine begs you to receive them. They are at the gate lodge.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Kaiser nodded. So the German Army was reunited with its Kaiser. The sky was not rent asunder, no fiery angels appeared, the voice of God remained silent. No longer the Kaiser&#x2019;s army, of course, but that fellow Hitler&#x2019;s, a corporal&#x2019;s army now. They would more likely view him as their prisoner than their king, unless&#x2014;but it was useless to speculate. It had come to something when it was hard to take any interest in one&#x2019;s future. He was more interested in this girl&#x2019;s accent. She came from Friesland, Hermo had said, so Fries was presumably her first language, Dutch her second, German evidently her third. There was something odd about her German, not an accent&#x2014;she had none&#x2014;but more her speech rhythm, her way of saying things. It reminded him of his grandmother, Queen Victoria, whose German was similarly fluent and unaccented but with something of the same difference. Not that pretty little Akki, with her hypnotic hands, was in any way like Grandmama.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are you from?&#x201d; he asked. Her surprise was gratifying. It was always good to surprise them a little.<br> <br>&#x201c;From Leeuwarden, Your Highness.&#x201d; She went on, evidently thinking he had not understood her. &#x201c;The Princess begs you to come to the house because German soldiers have arrived. They have invaded Holland, as Your Highness knows, and now they have come to see you. There is an officer with them. They are talking to our soldiers&#x2014;your Dutch guard&#x2014;at the gate lodge. The officer is from Schutzstaffel&#x2014;SS.&#x201d;<br> <br>She used the term familiarly. Perhaps, like him, the Dutch people had studied Corporal Hitler&#x2019;s armed forces. But he was Kaiser still, even if unrecognized in his own land. The Kaiser did not dance attendance upon people; they came to him, whether they called themselves SS or Wehrmacht or the Pink Lederhosen. &#x201c;Tell the Empress I shall join her when I have finished here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And beg her to invite the Dutch guard commander, Major van Houten, for lunch.&#x201d; He bent slowly and scooped up another log with his right hand. The girl bobbed a curtsey, backed a few steps, then turned and walked composedly through the rough grass towards the house. The morning dew lingered in the shade of the trees and she again clutched her apron. A pretty thing, he thought. Without doubt, were he a young man again, he would have sought to know her better, servant or no servant.<br> <br>This log, too, he split with gratifying ease, plumb down the middle. It fell open like the book of life before God, a perfect symmetry. He would sign the two halves and give them to visitors or deserving Dutch locals. They seemed to appreciate signed logs as much as his books. Perhaps the logs stood for books he had never written.<br> <br>He looked up at the barking of a dog. Arno, Hermo&#x2019;s bad-tempered German shepherd, was bounding across the lawn towards the Dutch girl as if she were a stranger. She stopped and faced the dog. Her admonitions were firm, but taut and nervous. The dog had taken against her from the day of her arrival, and she obviously feared him. Mind you, Arno disliked most people, and sometimes he bit them. That could be quite funny. A green woodpecker laughed raucously in the trees. The Kaiser resumed his chopping. After four more logs he lay down his ax. He had stayed long enough to show that he was in no hurry but not so long as seriously to upset Hermo, who would be excited and nervous. He strolled back along the track through the trees, contemplating his fine brick house as it came into view. It was a modest establishment compared with all his others, of course, but it was regularly and properly built, handsome in its own way. They had made many improvements so that it was now quite comfortable, even for the servants, and he had opened part of the park to the people of Doorn. From the day he arrived they had treated him with proper respect. Perhaps they had heard of his generosity to the people of Amerongen, the castle and village a few kilometers away where he had stayed when first in exile. He had built them a hospital, and signed many logs. With the Wehrmacht occupying Holland, however, it was possible that the people would turn against him, though perhaps not now that he was under the protection&#x2014;presumably&#x2014;of Herr Hitler. He had never met the fellow and had no idea what he planned but, for himself, he would die at Huis Doorn. Either way, they would have to carry him out.<br> <br>Neither Arno nor the girl was any longer to be seen as he approached the house but his own three dachshunds were yapping on the terrace. The gate lodge was some distance away but the sounds of army lorries and shouted orders carried across the park, exciting the dogs. His long-range vision was still good and he glimpsed the field gray of the Wehrmacht as soldiers milled around the lodge. It was an arrow in his eye, a stab of familiarity, love, resentment and bitterness. Even the sound of boots on gravel was wrenchingly familiar. He turned his head and slowly mounted the steps. He was hot in his blue serge suit, loden cape and hunting hat with feather, but did not wish to show it by removing anything. It was important that he should appear imperturbable, unhurried, his mind upon purposes invisible to others, higher purposes that rendered all else trivial. That was how emperors should appear.<br> <br>In the cool of the house he removed cape and hat and, with more effort, his heavy leather boots, then changed into a lighter gray suit which he wore with gold tie pin and the miniature pour le meritein in the buttonhole. Next, instead of going to Princess Hermine, he went to his study and sat for a while at his high desk with the saddle seat. It was always comforting to see his own things around him and to look upon the portrait of dear Dona. Normally he had just a sandwich and a glass of port after sawing or chopping but now that he had invited Major van Houten they would be hurrying to prepare something more elaborate, although still essentially simple. That was how he liked his food. Unless, that was, the Wehrmacht had already arrested or dismissed the Dutchman, though an invitation from the Kaiser should give them pause. It would be an early sign of their attitude towards him.<br> <br>When eventually he proceeded to the small dining room he found lunch already laid, an informal affair of cold meats and cheeses with cherries, apples, strawberries, peaches and oranges. Hermo was waiting, wearing a voluminous light green dress that covered her like a bell tent and filled out when she moved so that her progress through the house reminded him of those East Indiamen you used to see in the English Channel during the days of sail. It suited her; she was a stately, sometimes a superbly stately, woman. There were difficulties, of course, things she did not always understand, but it was far better to have a new empress than none. She was a handsome woman, and young, relatively speaking. Many people, he thought, must surely be jealous.<br> <br>&#x201c;His name is SS Untersturmf�hrer Krebbs,&#x201d; she said, with the Kaiser not yet through the door. &#x201c;And his first name is Martin.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Kaiser stared expressionlessly, as always when affronted by the unexpected.<br> <br>&#x201c;The officer in charge of the soldiers, the one from Schutzstaffel,&#x201d; she explained impatiently. Nervousness, or anxiety, had colored her plump cheeks.<br> <br>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; The Kaiser spoke quietly. It often intimidated people. &#x201c;What have I to do with an SS Untersturmf�hrer? That is the same as a Wehrmacht leutnant. A lieutenant, in other words. I have been a commissioned officer for seventy years. I was commissioned on my tenth birthday. Probably I was a leutnant before this puppy&#x2019;s grandfather was born.&#x201d; He took a glass of his favorite sparkling red wine from the tray proffered by a servant. It was Assmushausen, a good German wine that he cut with water. &#x201c;Why should I wish to know his name, especially his first name? What is it to me? You are surely not suggesting I should run to see him?&#x201d;<br> <br>The Princess smiled. &#x201c;Of course not, my dear, that would be unthinkable. Forgive me if I gave that impression. The shock of seeing our German soldiers here, of seeing our own dear uniforms again, has unsettled me. I lack your experience.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Kaiser pinched her cheek. &#x201c;That is natural, my pet. You must not worry yourself. All in good time. Now, where is Major van Houten? It is unlike him to be unpunctual, especially for the Kaiser.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He is on his way, he is coming. He has to negotiate something with Untersturmf�hrer Krebbs.&#x201d; Princess Hermine slipped her hand through her husband&#x2019;s docile left arm, steering him carefully towards the window. He had aged several years in the past one. &#x201c;Such a beautiful day.

Following Donne from Plague-ridden streets to palaces, from the taverns on the Bankside to the pulpit of St. Paul's, John Stubbs's biography is a vivid portrait of an extraordinary writer and his country at a time of bewildering and cruel transformation.</p><p>John Stubbs studied English at Oxford and Renaissance literature at Cambridge, where he completed a doctorate. John Donne was awarded a Royal Society of Literature Jerwood Award and shortlisted for the Costa Biography Award. Stubbs lives in Ljubljana, Slovenia.Reviewed by Michael Dirda<p>In 1619, shortly before his election as dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, one of the most distinguished clerics in England sent some of his youthful, and now rather embarrassing, writings to a friend. Included, for instance, was a tract called Biathanatos, which defended suicide. "Publish it not," the eminent churchman insisted, and yet "burn it not." As for the notorious love poems, well, manuscript copies of those had been circulating for years. They, he pointed out, had been "written by Jack Donne, and not by Dr. Donne." </p><p>For many readers, John Donne's "Songs and Sonnets" and "Elegies" are the earliest English poems to sound wholly modern. The poet literally shouts at us, "For God's sake, hold your tongue, and let me love." He can be cynical about casual sex -- "I have lov'd, and got, and told" -- and even ecstatically pornographic: "License my roving hands, and let them go,/ Before, behind, between, above, below." </p><p>A real human voice is always pushing against the constraints of meter, while the poetic similes are drawn from science, technology and contemporary history. Donne once compared true lovers to the legs of a draftsman's compass -- inseparable, no matter how far one wanders, and happiest when brought back together again. Even his most mystical speculations are grounded in the human and physical: "Love's mysteries in souls do grow/ But yet the body is his book."</p><p>Since Donne's virtual rediscovery around the time of World War I -- largely through the efforts of the scholar H.J.C. Grierson and the poet T.S. Eliot -- this great poet has usually been associated with the 17th century. Yet John Stubbs reminds us that much of his finest poetry was written during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Donne (1572-1631) was only eight years younger than Shakespeare. As a Londoner, born and bred, he drank at the Mermaid tavern, applauded the famous plays we now study in school, served as one of the Earl of Essex's men in naval operations against Spain. The swagger and vitality of Donne's poetic voice makes better sense as part of the roistering 1590s.</p><p>But whenever poets write about Eros, you can be sure that Thanatos -- Death -- is also on their minds. Donne imagines his skeleton disinterred (with a love token still intact: "a bracelet of bright hair about the bone"); he takes us to their bedside "as virtuous men pass mildly away"; in his best-known "Holy Sonnet" he trumpets the celebrated phrase: "Death be not proud." This obsession with mortality in a plague-stricken era carries over into his most popular prose work, the "Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions," a kind of sick-room diary. Its pages crackle with the stark immediacy we associate with the early poems: "Variable, and therefore miserable condition of Man; this minute I was well, and am ill, this minute. I am surpriz'd with a sodaine change, and alteration to worse, and can impute it to no cause, nor call it by any name." In later sections of these somber meditations, Donne widens his vision from the particular to the universal, his language rising gloriously to one of the most famous passages in all of English literature:</p><p>"No man is an Iland, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod bee washed away by the Sea, Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well as if a Mannor of thy friends or of thine owne were; any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee." </p><p>According to Stubbs, the importance of community, even of nation, was central to Donne's thought. Apart from his poetic originality and rhetorical magniloquence, he was surprisingly conventional, even something of a jingoist and occasionally a toady. He was born a Roman Catholic at a time when the Church was persecuted in England, when Jesuits acted as spies as well as priests, and the entire nation was riven with suspicion, hatred and fear. But by his 20s, Donne had rejected his natal religion, at least in part because it gave him no way to advance in life. Donne's family wasn't poor -- his father had made a good deal of money as an ironmonger -- and he attended Oxford and the equivalent of law school at the Inns of Court. But unless you were willing to conform to the Church of England, you might easily end up like Donne's brother -- dying in prison for aiding enemies of the state. Surely, what really mattered was simply to be a good and loving Christian. </p><p>After Donne had conformed to the English church, he started his climb up the rungs of the Elizabethan bureaucracy, starting very well indeed as the legal secretary to Sir Thomas Egerton, Lord Keeper of the Seal. Then he made what his first biographer, Izaak Walton, called the mistake of his life: In his late 20s, the young go-getter fell in love with the teenaged Ann More, the daughter of Sir George More. They married secretly, and when the truth came out, Donne lost his job, Ann was turned out by her father, and the two lovebirds were faced with utter poverty. (As the epigram had it: "John Donne, Ann Donne, Undone.") The couple were taken in by a relative of Ann's, and for 10 years Donne scraped and bowed to regain his lost position in society. To no avail. After all, he had committed a serious act of theft, depriving the More family of a valuable commodity, for in those days a marriage was based on money and social position, not something as silly as love. And then there were those naughty poems! So Donne took on freelance legal work, studied theology and languages on the side, and gave his wife baby after baby.</p><p>Because he was a fundamentally serious man, but also because he was an increasingly desperate one, the priesthood began to make more and more sense. By now the harried husband and father was in his 40s, James I was on the throne and some of his youthful indiscretions had been forgiven. Once ordained in 1615 -- no one seems to have bothered about special training -- Donne learned to preach brilliantly, to employ his skillful pen as a tool of the king and to tread carefully in theological contests between the austere Puritans and what we might now call the more ritualistic Anglo-Catholics. </p><p>Ann died only a few years into his new career -- she was just 33 and had borne him a dozen children, only half of whom survived to adulthood -- and he never married again. Indeed, in his later years Donne inveighed against the snares of the flesh, reminding us with his wondrous eloquence that we are just "a volume of diseases bound together" and that "all our life is but a going out to the place of execution, to death." He added, driving home the point, "Nor was there ever any man seen to sleep in the cart between Newcastle and Tyburn -- between prison and the place of execution, does any man sleep? And we sleep all the way; from the womb to the grave we are never thoroughly awake." Open your eyes, sinner, and look to your salvation.</p><p>The author of "The Extasie" and "On His Mistress Going to Bed" may be the first English poet about whom a true and relatively full biography can be written. We possess volumes of letters, sermons, verse and lots of secondary material. In John Donne: The Reformed Soul, the young English scholar John Stubbs employs all these, focusing resolutely on the life rather than the work. Sometimes he presumes, a little rashly, to quote lines from the poems as registers of actual events and feelings. In the end, he also suggests that we understand the mature John Donne as a figure of moderation at a time of increasing religious fanaticism. Fair enough. But most of us will still prefer the bravado of rakish Jack Donne -- "I can love both fair and brown . . . I can love her, and her, and you, and you" -- or the hellfire eloquence of St. Paul's Dr. Donne:</p><p>"God is the Lord of Hosts, and he can proceed by martial law; he can hang thee upon the next tree; he can choke thee with a crumb, with a drop, at a voluptuous feast; he can sink down the stage and the player, the bed of wantonness and the wanton actor, into the jaws of death, into the mouth of hell; he can surprise thee, even in the act of sin." </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

What is sin and where did it come from? How is Jesus fully God and fully man? What are spiritual gifts? When and how will Christ return? If you&#39;ve asked questions like these, then &#39;systematic theology&#39; is no abstract term. It&#39;s an approach to finding answers every Christian needs to know. Bible Doctrine takes a highly commended upper-level textbook on systematic theology and makes it accessible to the average reader. Abridged from Wayne Grudem&#39;s award-winning Systematic Theology, Bible Doctrine covers the same essentials of the faith, giving you a firm grasp on seven key topics: The Doctrine of the Word of God The Doctrine of God The Doctrine of Man The Doctrine of Christ The Doctrine of the Application of Redemption The Doctrine of the Church The Doctrine of the Future Like Systematic Theology, this book is marked by its clarity, its strong scriptural emphasis, its thoroughness in scope and detail, and its treatment of such timely topics as spiritual warfare and the gifts of the Spirit. But you don&#39;t need to have had several years of Bible school to reap the full benefits of Bible Doctrine. It&#39;s easy to understand--and it&#39;s packed with solid, biblical answers to your most important questions.</p><p>Systematic theology can be an intimidating subject to tackle. But Bible Doctrine makes it accessible to students and laypersons who want to understand more about the Bible, God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, Mankind, Redemption, the Church, and the Future. An abridgment of Grudem&#39;s classic text, Systematic Theology, this book meets a need expressed by many who value his scholarship and writing ability but want a theology book that is understandable on a non-graduate-student level. Thorough without being overbearing, Bible Doctrine is a user-friendly book that covers all the main topics in systematic theology.Wayne Grudem is professor of biblical and systematic theology at Trinitiy Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois. He holds degrees from Harvard (B.A.), Westminster Seminary (M.Div.), and Cambridge (Ph.D.).

After the death of her parents, Angela moves to New York to escape the racism she believes is her only obstacle to opportunity. What she soon discovers is that being a woman has its own burdens that don&#39;t fade with the color of one&#39;s skin, and that love and marriage might not offer her salvation.</p><p>Jessie Redmon Fauset (1882-1961) was literary editor of <i>Crisis</i> from 1919 to 1926. She is the author of four novels, including <i>The Chinaberry Tree.</i>An engrossing novel of women's lives and experiences. . . . Jessie Redmon Fauset uses Angela's development as the springboard to explore larger issues that have become regarded as central to black women's fiction: the experience of passing, the exploitation of women as sexual objects and thus a questioning of heterosexual relationships, the assertion of racial pride, and the primacy of female bonding. --Mary Katherine Wainwright, <i>Belles Lettres</i><br><br>"A fascinating glimpse of a now-vanished Harlem culture." --Rosalind Warren, <i>New Directions for Women</i><br><br>"A reminder of how entertaining good writing can be." --Ernest R.

A successful L.A. comedian, he&#x2019;s just a regular guy, with his fair share of fears, egocentricities, and addictions. After his father&#x2019;s death, Mickey meets a mysterious stranger named Francisco, who changes his life forever. The two begin an ongoing discussion about the true nature of being. Reluctantly at first, Mickey accepts the stranger&#x2019;s help and starts to explore his own life in an effort to answer the riddles Francisco poses. Mickey starts to look at those aspects of himself that he has hidden behind a wall of wisecracks all his life. Eventually Mickey realizes that authentic humor opens him up to the power of spirit&#x2014;allowing him to finally make real connections with people. <br><br>After taking the reader on a journey with Mickey, Chopra then spells out the lessons that Mickey&#x2019;s story imparts to us: ten reasons to be optimistic, even in our challenging world. Chopra believes that the healthiest response to life is laughter from the heart, and even in the face of global turmoil, we can cultivate an internal sense of optimism. Rich with humor and practical advice, <i>Why Is God Laughing?</i> shows us without a doubt that there is always a reason to be grateful, that every possibility holds the promise of abundance, and that obstacles are simply opportunities in disguise. In the end, we really don&#x2019;t need a reason to be happy. The power of happiness lies within each of us, just waiting to be unleashed.

Online promo.</p><p>William F. Buckley Jr. is the founder of National Review and was the host of what was television&#39;s longest-running program, Firing Line. He was recently awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The author of thirteen other novels, including Spytime and Nuremberg: The Reckoning, he lives in Connecticut.A whimsical miscellany that is essentially what Vaughan (Buckley's editor at Doubleday), in his introduction, calls it, a ``book on language,'' although it does not hold itself opprobrious, reprehensible, or peccant for wandering off topic. Letters, essays, interviews, speeches, and columns by National Review editor Buckley (Brothers No More, 1995, etc.), along with some letters written back to him, explore subjects as varied as the origin of Buckley's fictional spy Blackford Oakes, subjunctives, Norman Mailer, and the Roman Catholic Church's abandonment of the Latin mass. Of course, Buckley does hold forth on fine points of English usage, but even he has his limit, as demonstrated when one correspondent, after taking exception to Buckley's usage of ``momentarily,'' explores various ``sleazy blunders in word usage.'' Buckley's response: ``Aw, lay off, fellas.'' Such moments of humor, generously sprinkled throughout, do much to give the book its appeal. For example, Buckley experiments with translation software by using it to render two brief notes into French and then back into English, with predictably hilarious results. Of the interviews, there is a particularly memorable one with Jorge Luis Borges; discussing his admiration for English, the great writer notes that its Latin and Germanic roots give it ``two registers.'' There is a group of reviews, including one of Henry James's travel writings, which Buckley adores (the prose is ``so resplendent it will sweep you off your feet''), and one of the movie The Right Stuff, which, he says, lacks the ``leavening humor'' that Tom Wolfe's writing brought to the subject. In a chapter of obituaries, Buckley pays respect to a range of people, from Claire Boothe Luce to his own mother. An appendix of ``Buckley lexicons'' will attract only those burning to know how Buckley uses terms such as ``matrix'' or ``pertinacity.'' In all, an assortment to entertain even some language lovers who find Buckley's politics less than amusing. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Sporting names like The Box Kite, The Bra, and The Reclining Picasso, his whimsical vacation homes of the 1950s and 1960s dotted the coasts of Long Island, Martha's Vineyard, and the Jersey Shore. Made mostly of wood, they combined a modern interest in light, breeze, and functional living with playful form-making. In contrast to the today's Hamptons megamansions, Geller's inexpensive homes were modest in scale and reflected the ideas of summer leisure of a generation more concerned with fun on the beach than ostentatious display. Now available in paperback, <em>Beach Houses</em> features more than fifty of these spirited houses in rarely seen vintage photographs and drawings.</p><p>Alastair Gordon is contributing editor for architecture and design at <em>WSJ</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> magazineGordon (Weekend Utopia) takes readers on a tour of "quixotic designer-architect" Geller's beach houses in this handsomely illustrated homage. Geller, a long-time designer at the Loewy Corporation, a pioneering industrial design firm, made a name for himself in the 1950s and 60s when he began taking commissions to build architecturally adventurous summer houses in Sagaponack, Amagansett and other beach towns. His playful designs made the most of their location-generally, these were small houses on small lots, and windows opening onto the beach were crucial-and often reflected important parts of their owners' personalities: a Kodak executive's house was a boxy structure with "lenslike" windows, while a well-known ladies' man's dwelling looked a little like a "square brassiere." Later, Geller worked on the Leisurama brand of prefabricated summer homes, which were sold at Macy's and came furnished, right down to towels and toothbrushes. As Gordon writes, "each one of Geller's houses told a story and sometimes, in his best work, this story took the form of a kind of comic-strip imagery that recalled Krazy Kat, Rube Goldberg, Betty Boop, and the bebop jazz that Geller admired." While many of the houses Geller designed were destroyed in hurricanes, demolished to make room for McMansions or remodeled and expanded beyond recognition, the photographs and architectural drawings in this volume bring them appealingly back to life. 25 color, 60 b&amp;w illustrations. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Day in the Life of Ireland</h2><p>Creates a visual time capsule that includes scenes from the country&#39;s musical, medical, artistic, and technological communities</p><p>On one day in May 1991 more than 75 distinguished photographers undertook to capture on film the many sides of Ireland and its people.

Living in the presence of God she has found unconditional love and acceptance, healing for crippled emotions, contentment that overcomes depression, peace in the midst of adverse circumstances and grace for developing healthy relationships. The ongoing process of transformation evolved into praying for others, and the prayer of intercession became her prayer focus.

Martha C. Nussbaum, philosopher and classicist, argues that contemporary curricular reform is already producing such "citizens of the world" in its advocacy of diverse forms of cross-cultural studies. Her vigorous defense of "the new education" is rooted in Seneca's ideal of the citizen who scrutinizes tradition critically and who respects the ability to reason wherever it is found--in rich or poor, native or foreigner, female or male. </p><p> Drawing on Socrates and the Stoics, Nussbaum establishes three core values of liberal education--critical self-examination, the ideal of the world citizen, and the development of the narrative imagination. Then, taking us into classrooms and campuses across the nation, including prominent research universities, small independent colleges, and religious institutions, she shows how these values are (and in some instances are not) being embodied in particular courses. She defends such burgeoning subject areas as gender, minority, and gay studies against charges of moral relativism and low standards, and underscores their dynamic and fundamental contribution to critical reasoning and world citizenship. </p><p> For Nussbaum, liberal education is alive and well on American campuses in the late twentieth century. It is not only viable, promising, and constructive, but it is essential to a democratic society. Taking up the challenge of conservative critics of academe, she argues persuasively that sustained reform in the aim and content of liberal education is the most vital and invigorating force in higher education today. </p></p><p>Multiculturalism is often attacked in higher education as either a bankrupt moral relativism or an anti-white-male power play. In <i>Cultivating Humanity</i>, philosopher Martha Nussbaum draws on some dead white males, namely Socrates, Seneca, and Cicero, to defend diversity studies in higher education. Nussbaum examines diversity programs in universities across America and finds that by coupling diversity studies with rigorous philosophical inquiry the programs are quite successful at accomplishing their mission: to turn out citizens well-grounded in their own culture and with the rational capacity and empathy to understand and explore differing points of view. For anyone who questions the necessity of a liberal education in a university curriculum, <i>Cultivating Humanity</i> is required reading.<b>Martha C.

One day, she and a friend are approached by a wandering beggar. They race to the house, frightened, but Mother decides that the man should have some of their just-made strudel. He repays their kindness by playing sweet, sad music on his violin. Each year he returns, has his piece of strudel, and plays, until finally one season the harvest comes, but the beggar does not. Father says that "Perhaps our friend isn't hungry anymore." He tells the children to listen closely, and they hear the wanderer's music in the sounds of the country night. Comparisons with Patricia Polacco's Thunder Cake (Philomel, 1990) are bound to occur. Similarities include the grandmother from the old country, the child who helps prepare a treat, the sharing of food in the spirit of kindness, and the recipe on the last page. Even the watercolor-and-pencil illustrations have a similar, though softer, look. But with its message of continuity and love, Hippely's sweet story stands on its own.?Ruth Semrau, formerly at Lovejoy School, Allen, TX<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 4^-7. As Lena's grandmother makes strudel, she tells Lena a story about when she was a little girl in Hungary helping her mama bake. An old fellow in tattered clothes asks for a piece of bread, but Mama can't give bread when there is fresh strudel in the house. The man gratefully accepts and, to the family's surprise, repays them--with a song from his violin. Each year he comes back, until one year he doesn't, and Papa tells his girls that perhaps the man is no longer hungry, and if they listen carefully, they might still hear his song. The story, hauntingly sweet, is matched by the dreamy watercolors in autumnal shades. However, the narrative frame features a grandmother who looks more like Lena's great-grandmother. White-haired, stooped, this grandmother remembers a childhood where people wear costumes that seem to be from the turn of the century. This quibble aside, children will enjoy the story's warmth. A recipe for strudel is appended. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Wreckage</h2><p><p><strong>Baghdad. Billions of dollars slipping into thin air.</strong></p><p><strong>London. A girl on the run.

With a few tricks still in his bag, Brandstetter proves a formidable investigator whose reputation is enhanced by a Time magazine interview. This accolade to his credit, the public defenders' office hires him to probe the murder of a prominent Vietnamese businessman and clear their client, Andy Flanagan, a suspect in the killing. During the investigation, he stumbles onto two more murders in the Vietnamese community, linking them to a startling drug smuggling discovery in the dead importer's waterfront warehouse. Brandstetter's relationship with Cecil Harris, his housemate from Early Grave (1987) continues, this aspect of the story handled with intelligence and sensitivity. The mystery, though contrived, is fast-paced and literate, while revealing little-known facts about Indo-Chinese lifestyles in America. Hansen readers should delight in this latest caper. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hansen continues his well-established Brandstetter series with Dave, a straight-acting, well-accepted gay, on the verge of retirement. Out of deference to a friend, however, he takes on one more case. Vietnamese investor Le Van Minh, owner of the Old Fleet Marina, has just sold it, which means the boat people living there must leave. Dave, who rejects this as motivation for Le's subsequent murder, quickly uncovers evidence of drug smuggling. California settings with an East Asian twist, crisp prose, increasing tension, and a satisfying conclusion add to the excitement. Recommended.

A dark and ferocious comic masterpiece, the novel traces the turbulent emotional journey of Martin Lynch-Gibbon, a smug, well-to-do London wine merchant and unfaithful husband, whose life is turned inside out when his wife leaves him for her psychoanalyst. In The Sea, the Sea the landscape shifts to the seclusion of an isolated house on the edge of England&#39;s North Sea, where Charles Arrowby, a big name in London&#39;s glittering theatrical world, has retired to write his memoirs. Arrowby&#39;s plans begin to unravel when he meets his first love and becomes haunted by the idea of rekindling his adolescent passion. The Severed Head and Booker prize-winner The Sea, the Sea are two of Iris Murdoch&#39;s most accomplished novels, displaying all her talent for combining profundity with playful creativity. Both tragic and comic, brooding and hilarious, they brilliantly reveal how much our lives are governed by the lies we tell ourselves as well as our all-consuming desire for love, significance and, ultimately, redemption.</p><p>Iris Murdoch was born in Dublin in 1919.

He is considered "a modern saint" who offered protection to his people during the Cultural Revolution; an admirable figure in an otherwise traumatic and bloody era. Works about Zhou in China are heavily censored, and every hint of criticism is removed&#x2014;so when Gao Wenqian first published this groundbreaking, provocative biography in Hong Kong, it was immediately banned in the People's Republic.<p> Using classified documents spirited out of China, Gao Wenqian offers an objective human portrait of the real Zhou, a man who lived his life at the heart of Chinese politics for fifty years, who survived both the Long March and the Cultural Revolution not thanks to ideological or personal purity, but because he was artful, crafty, and politically supple. He may have had the looks of a matinee idol, and Nixon may have called him "the greatest statesman of our era," but Zhou's greatest gift was to survive, at almost any price, thanks to his acute understanding of where political power resided at any one time.</p></p><p><b>Gao Wenqian</b> is the former official biographer of Zhou Enlai at the Chinese Institute of Central Documents. He participated in preparing the official versions of <i>Biography of Mao Zedong</i> and <i>Biography of Zhou Enlai</i>, granting him access to highly classified archives of the Chinese Communist Party. Gao came to the U.S. in 1993 as visiting scholar at Columbia University. Later, he received funding from the Wilson International Center at Princeton University and Harvard University. He lives in Queens, New York."(t)he story of this great survivor is celebrated in a new biography written by Gao Wenqian, a former insider in the Chinese Communist Party's research department... (A)s Gao points out, the collapse of the former Soviet Union and East European Communist countries began with the demystification of official history and the re-evaluation of major historical events and people. This is his contribution to that process in his native country." -- <i><i>Tribune</i>, December 30th, 2007</i><br><br>"Mr Gao's biography does supply some new information about how Mao's closest lieutenants, notably Zhou Enlai, usually obeyed him, at first because they shared his ruthlessness, and later, understandably if contemptibly, to save themselves." -- <i><i>Far Eastern Economic Review</i>, December Issue</i><br><br>"a valuable and revealing book on the brutish and incredibly cruel nature of the Maoist regime... For a sense of what life as a top Communist leader under Mao was like look no further." -- <i><i>BBC History Magazine</i>, January Issue</i><br><br>"an incredibly fascinating eyewitness or well researched account about a man the West knew little about." -- <i><i>Daily Kos</i>, December 12th, 2007</i></p><h2>Writing Down the Bones: Freeing the Writer Within (Shambhala Library)</h2><p>With insight, humor, and practicality, Natalie Goldberg inspires writers and would-be writers to take the leap into writing skillfully and creatively.

One is born a slave and tempts a Vestal virgin to break her vows. One becomes a mass murderer. And one&nbsp;becomes the heir of Julius Caesar. Linking the generations is a mysterious talisman as ancient as the city itself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Epic in every sense of the word, Roma is a panoramic historical saga and Saylor&#x2019;s finest achievement to date.</p><p>This book marks a departure from my Roma Sub Rosa series. I wanted to try my hand at a truly epic novel, and to explore the remarkable ten centuries that came before the time of <i>Gladiator</i>, HBO's <i>Rome</i>, and my own books. This is the story of how the Romans created the greatest city on earth -- the story of how Rome became Rome.Seven Saylor is the author of the critically acclaimed historical mystery novels set in ancient Rome, the Roma <i>Sub Rosa,</i> featuring Gordianus the Finder. He has appeared repeatedly on the History Channel as an expert on Roman politics and life. He divides his time between Berkeley, California, and Austin, Texas.</p><h2>La Regenta (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Married to the retired magistrate of Vetusta, Ana Ozores cares deeply for her much older husband but feels stifled by the monotony of her life in the shabby and conservative provincial town. And when she embarks on a quest for fulfillment through religion and even adultery, a bitter struggle begins between a powerful priest and a would-be Don Juan for the passionate young woman's body and soul. Scandalizing contemporary Spain when it was first published in 1885, with its searing critique of the Church and its frank treatment of sex, <i>La Regenta </i>is a compelling and witty depiction of the complacent and frivolous world of upper-class society.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

This is a &#34;nature book,&#34; but a deceptively simple one: for, like Thoreau, Miss Johnson goes far beyond a mere description of nature. Her &#34;inland island&#34; is both her own farm - an enclosure of wilderness surrounded by an ever more savage and intrusive society - and the burning core of her convictions about man&#39;s cruelty, the demands of individual conscience at a time of war and conflict, her own determination to resist an increasingly brutalized and mechanical civilization.</p><p></p><h2>Lenin the Dictator</h2><p>First we must seize power, Lenin told Trotsky in 1917. Then we decide what to do with it. This compelling biography draws on long-suppressed documents to present a nuanced portrait of this complex, emotional man. It charts his long years in exile, his decisive seizure of power, and his intense relationships with his wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, and his lover, Inessa Armand, examining how this sensitive nature lover came to create a new kind of state.</p><p>Victor Sebestyen is the acclaimed author of TWELVE DAYS, REVOLUTION 1989 and 1946. He was born in Budapest, and was a child when his family left Hungary as refugees. As a journalist, he has worked for numerous British newspapers, including the EVENING STANDARD, DAILY MAIL and THE TIMES. He reported widely from Eastern Europe when Communism collapsed and the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. He covered the wars in former Yugoslavia and the breakup of the Soviet Union. At the EVENING STANDARD he was foreign editor, media editor and chief leader writer. He is an associate editor of NEWSWEEK.1<br><br>A Nest of Gentlefolk<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry about Lenin. The man is not dangerous.&#x2019; <br><br>Prince Georgy Lvov, the first post-imperial Prime Minister of Russia<br><br>All of the most important relationships in Lenin&#x2019;s life were with women. He had very few close male friends and nearly without exception he lost those he made, or they fell by the wayside, because of politics. Men had to agree with him wholesale and bend to his will or be dropped from his inner circle. As a confidant for many years in exile recalled: &#x2018;I began to separate myself from the revolutionary movement . . . and thus completely ceased to exist for Vladimir Ilyich.&#x2019; By the time he was thirty-three the only man he addressed by the intimate Russian &#x2018;ty&#x2019; rather than the formal &#x2018;vy&#x2019; was his younger brother Dmitry. <br><br>For most of his life Lenin was surrounded by women &#x2013; his mother, sisters, his wife of a quarter of a century, Nadya; and his mistress Inessa Armand, with whom he had a complex romantic attachment, as well as a close working relationship, that waxed and waned in intensity over many years. During a decade and a half of exile, in various cramped lodging houses throughout Europe, he lived in easy, friendly familiarity with his mother-in-law, a woman of strong opinions that differed markedly from his own. <br><br>Invariably, Lenin&#x2019;s women have been dismissed as mere drudges who performed domestic chores for him or were allowed to handle relatively simple and mundane political tasks. This is misleading. Lenin had more progressive and advanced views about the role of women than most of his male contemporaries in the revolutionary movement &#x2013; though it is true that this does not set the bar particularly high. <br><br>In many ways, Lenin the great radical was a conventional Russian bourgeois man of the late nineteenth century: hardly a feminist in the modern sense of the term. He expected the women close to him to cosset him, fuss over him and look after him, which they did. But he listened to them and took them as seriously in political matters as he did men. <br><br>His wife, Nadya, is frequently portrayed as little more than his secretary, an amanuensis with no opinions of her own. Yet there was much more to her than that. She was a revolutionary when she met him, had been jailed and exiled to Siberia before she married him, and she played a vital role alongside him in the underground conspiratorial network that kept the flame of revolution alive in Russia before 1917. She wrote no works on Marxism or philosophy, seldom spoke up about political tactics or policy, and rarely contradicted him, but Lenin relied on her practical skills and sound judgement. She &#x2018;ran&#x2019; dozens of secret Bolshevik agents throughout the Russian empire and knew every aspect of the Party organisation. Most importantly, Nadya kept her husband&#x2019;s temper and fast-changing moods in check, which often demanded immense tact. <br><br>Inessa Armand was another woman whose role in his life has been misunderstood, or &#x2013; in the case of the Soviet authorities after Lenin&#x2019;s death &#x2013; deliberately ignored. For ten years until she died in 1920 they had an on-off love affair. Armand was central to his emotional life. She was also among the best-known women socialists of her generation, one of Lenin&#x2019;s closest aides, trusted to perform the most confidential tasks. Often she represented him at international gatherings of revolutionaries, a responsibility he delegated to very few people. She held positions by Lenin&#x2019;s side in Moscow after the Revolution. Frequently she disagreed with him and plainly told him so, yet they remained inseparable. Everyone who knew her &#x2013; including Lenin&#x2019;s wife, who became her close friend in a curiously touching and devoted triangular relationship &#x2013; understood how important she was to him. Yet after he died a &#x2018;cult&#x2019; of Lenin was developed by his successors which encouraged worship of him as a secular icon representing the pillar of Bolshevik rectitude and she was all but written out of Soviet history books. In the five years before 1917 he wrote many more letters to Inessa Armand &#x2013; on personal and political matters &#x2013; than to anyone else. Their correspondence and her diaries were censored for nearly seventy years until the Communist state that Lenin founded collapsed. <br><br>Two of Lenin&#x2019;s sisters survived past their teens and worked with him closely in the revolutionary underground. Anna Ilyinichna Ulyanova, born in 1864, was his elder by six years; Maria was eight years younger than he. Both were repeatedly jailed or exiled during the Tsarist regime for subversive activities; they helped to smuggle underground agents and socialist literature into and out of Russia. After the Revolution they held responsible jobs in the Soviet regime. For many years in exile in Europe, one or both of them &#x2013; usually Maria &#x2013; shared his home, with Nadya and his mother-in-law.<br><br>Throughout his life Lenin relied on a network of devoted women totally loyal to him &#x2013; and, most of them, to his revolutionary cause. They made great sacrifices for his career and at times took enormous personal risks on his behalf: Revolution was a dangerous business. He could, and sometimes did, take their faith in him for granted. But the commitments went both ways. <br><br>Many ruthless and cynical men are sentimental about their mothers. Lenin used to say frequently to family and comrades, &#x2018;Mother . . . well, quite simply, she&#x2019;s a saint.&#x2019; He saw her rarely for the last twenty years of her life &#x2013; she died in 1916, while he was in Swiss exile &#x2013; but he was a devoted, not merely a dutiful, correspondent. Wherever he was on his wanderings about Europe he wrote to her regularly. The letters were rarely about politics or his literary/journalistic work, but he reported, often in minute detail, on his domestic arrangements, his health and his travels. Many are of a &#x2018;nature notes&#x2019; type about his hunting trips or excursions in the Alps, one of his great passions being walking in mountains and the untamed countryside. His letters home are invariably addressed to &#x2018;Darling Mother&#x2019; or &#x2018;Mamoushka Dearest&#x2019;. His last, a few weeks before her death, ends: &#x2018;I embrace you warmly my dearest and wish you vigour.&#x2019; Lenin was petulant, ill-tempered and irascible, especially as he grew older, but his mother was the one person he never complained about to anybody, the only one to whom he always showed unqualified love.<br><br>Maria Alexandrovna Blank was born in 1835 in St Petersburg. Her father was an eccentric, a martinet and &#x2013; a fact kept strictly secret by the Soviet authorities after Lenin&#x2019;s death &#x2013; a Jew. He had been born Sril (the Yiddish form of Israel) Moiseyevich (Moses) Blank in Odessa, but while studying medicine he converted to Orthodoxy and changed his first name and patronymic to Alexander Dmitriyevich. He travelled widely in Europe after qualifying as a doctor and married the daughter of a wealthy German merchant, Anna Groschopf. She was a Protestant. Under the restrictive religious laws of Tsarist Russia, his wife was required to convert to the Orthodox faith, but she refused and brought up her six children as Lutherans.<br><br>Alexander Blank began as an army surgeon, later became a police doctor and, finally, an inspector of hospitals at Zlatoust, in the vast province of Chelyabinsk in western Siberia. This gave him the civil service rank of &#x2018;state councillor&#x2019;, which entitled him to claim noble status. When he retired in his fifties he registered as a member of the nobility of Kazan and he bought an estate, Kokushkino, about thirty kilometres north-east of the city, with a fine manor house and forty serfs who worked the land. <br><br>Maria Alexandrovna&#x2019;s mother died when she was three. Her father began living with his late wife&#x2019;s sister, Ekaterina von Essen, herself widowed. It was a shocking m�nage for those days and Blank wanted to make an honest woman of his sister-in-law. He tried to marry her, but the marriage was illegal in the eyes of the Church and the couple were refused permission. Her money helped to buy the Kokushkino estate and they remained together until she died in 1863.<br><br>A quiet, strong-willed, introverted woman, Lenin&#x2019;s mother had dark-brown hair, a slim figure and dressed elegantly, though rarely in the height of fashion. There was no kissing or embracing within the household and Maria Alexandrovna generally discouraged displays of emotion. She was the dominant figure at home, deeply respected and revered by all her children. &#x2018;She had our love and obedience,&#x2019; the eldest Ulyanov daughter, Anna, recalled later. &#x2018;She never raised her voice, and almost never resorted to punishment.&#x2019; <br><br>She was long-suffering and always sheltered her children from the reduced circumstances they would face following family deaths and the constant attention of the secret police. She was frugal but never mean. Intelligent and well educated, she never supported &#x2013; and often did not understand &#x2013; her children&#x2019;s radical politics. She was certainly not a Marxist or a revolutionary of any kind. But she knew better than to quarrel with her children over a political issue or ask too many questions about their illegal activities, whatever the suffering their beliefs would bring them. Few of her letters to her son Vladimir have survived, but in those she barely mentioned politics once. To Maria Alexandrovna, family came first. <br><br>At various points all of her grown-up children were jailed or exiled, on occasions several of them at once. She would always move near their prison or to a town as close as possible to their place of exile. Often she would humiliate herself pleading with officials to release one of her daughters or sons, or to treat them more leniently. Though never rich, she was comfortably off and all of them relied on her money for prolonged periods. She sent them cash, clothes, books, food parcels and never appeared to complain about being asked. Vladimir would request help more than any of her other children, though at times he received ample funds from elsewhere. For some years he awarded himself a salary from Bolshevik Party funds, but he earned little from his books and journalism. Life as a professional revolutionary could be precarious and at times he was short of ready money; well into his forties he could not have survived without regular help from his mother. <br><br>Vladimir possessed little of the serenity and patient forbearance of Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, but he did inherit other features of her character. &#x2018;No sooner had I come to know his mother than I discovered the secret of Vladimir Ilyich&#x2019;s charm,&#x2019; said Ivan Baranov, a comrade from Lenin&#x2019;s early revolutionary years. <br><br>His father&#x2019;s ancestry was as problematic as his mother&#x2019;s for Soviet historians. The last official Lenin biography published in the USSR, which appeared in the 1950s, stated that his father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, hailed from &#x2018;poor lower-middle-class people from Astrakhan&#x2019;, which hides more than it tells. Lenin&#x2019;s paternal grandmother, Anna Alexeyevna Smirnov, was an illiterate Kalmyk woman with Central Asian roots who possessed the typical looks of her ethnic origin. Most physical descriptions of Lenin mention his &#x2018;Mongol eyes&#x2019; and high cheekbones, but the Soviets systematically suppressed information about his grandparents. They would not have fitted neatly with the carefully burnished official image of the founder of Bolshevism, who had to be presented as a Great Russian through and through.<br><br>Ilya was born in 1831 and both his parents died young. He was brought up and given a good education by his uncle Vasily, a prosperous tailor and merchant who ran a successful business in Astrakhan, a smelly fishing town along the delta where the Volga flows into the Caspian Sea. He qualified as a teacher of the sciences and taught at a series of secondary schools in provincial towns in southern Russia. He married in 1863 and taught in Nizhny Novgorod until 1869, when he was given a big promotion as Inspector of Schools in the Simbirsk Region, a job that won him the rank of a hereditary noble. <br><br>Of all the Ulyanov children, Vladimir looked the most like his father. Ilya Ulyanov had slanted eyes that flashed amber, a big domed forehead and reddish hair which he began to lose in his early twenties. Like his son he couldn&#x2019;t pronounce his &#x2018;r&#x2019;s properly and on occasions he had a hint of a lisp. He was more outgoing than his wife and enjoyed company. He was away much of the time on tours of inspection around the vast schools district under his supervision. Lenin&#x2019;s mother, although nominally Lutheran, seldom went to church. His father was religious and ensured that the children were brought up Orthodox in a traditional Russian manner. <br><br>He was a thoroughly decent man of liberal views, who believed in gradual reform and evolutionary change through education &#x2013; the kind of well-meaning bourgeois that his son would come to despise and scorn more bitterly than he did a diehard reactionary. Ilya revered Alexander II, the &#x2018;Tsar Liberator&#x2019; who emancipated the serfs in 1861 and launched a series of other modest measures to modernise the Romanov autocracy. After he was assassinated in 1881 by terrorists from the People&#x2019;s Will revolutionary group Ilya Ulyanov wept for days. In full-dress civil service uniform he attended the memorial service at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Simbirsk. He was a proud member of the establishment. As far as is recorded he was in contact with only one known &#x2018;subversive&#x2019;, the Ulyanov family doctor, Alexander Kadyan, who had been sent into internal exile by the secret police and was forced under the terms of his sentence to stay within the town. But the acquaintanceship was entirely professional. <br><br>&#x2018;Our father was never a revolutionary,&#x2019; Anna wrote in her short history of the family. &#x2018;In those years, being in his forties and head of the family, he wanted to protect us, his children, from that way of thinking.&#x2019; Her sister Maria agreed. &#x2018;Father was totally loyal to the Tsarist regime, certainly not a revolutionary,&#x2019; she told a younger comrade. &#x2018;We don&#x2019;t really know enough to say what his attitudes were to the radical activities of the young.&#x2019;<br><br>Lenin himself never tried to conceal or fudge his roots, though the Soviets later created the myth that the founder of the world&#x2019;s first workers&#x2019; state &#x2018;came from the people&#x2019; and was from &#x2018;low social origins&#x2019;. To many of those who knew him, his manner and bearing were revealing. Maxim Gorky, a convinced socialist who was born into deep poverty and really did come from the people, said that &#x2018;Vladimir Ilyich has the self-belief of a &#x201c;leader&#x201d;, a Russian nobleman not without some of the psychological traits of that class.&#x2019;</p><h2>What Has Government Done to Our Money?</h2><p><p>The book made huge theoretical advances. He was the first to prove that the government, and only the government, can destroy money on a mass scale, and he showed exactly how they go about this dirty deed. But just as importantly, it is beautifully written. He tells a thrilling story because he loves the subject so much.</p><p> The passion that Murray feels for the topic comes through in the prose and transfers to the reader. Readers become excited about the subject, and tell others. Students tell professors. Some, like the great Ron Paul of Texas, have even run for political office after having read it.</p><p> Rothbard shows precisely how banks create money out of thin air and how the central bank, backed by government power, allows them to get away with it. He shows how exchange rates and interest rates would work in a true free market. When it comes to describing the end of the gold standard, he is not content to describe the big trends. He names names and ferrets out all the interest groups involved. </p><p> Since Rothbard's death, scholars have worked to assess his legacy, and many of them agree that this little book is one of his most important. Though it has sometimes been inauspiciously packaged and is surprisingly short, its argument took huge strides toward explaining that it is impossible to understand public affairs in our time without understanding money and its destruction.</p><p> </p><p>This volume's contents include:</p><ul> <li>Preface by J�rg Guido H�lsmann </li><li>I.

(<i>Edward Stourton</i>)</b><br><br><b>From much-loved historian Neil Oliver, comes this beautifully written, </b><b>kaleidoscopic</b><b> history of a place with a story like no other.</b><br><br>The British Isles, this archipelago of islands, is to Neil Oliver the best place in the world. From north to south, east to west it cradles astonishing beauty. The human story here is a million years old, and counting. But the tolerant, easygoing peace we enjoy has been hard won. We have made and known the best and worst of times. We have been hero and villain and all else in between, and we have learned some lessons.<br><br><i>The Story of the British Isles in 100 Places </i>is Neil&#x2019;s very personal account of what makes these islands so special, told through the places that have witnessed the unfolding of our history. Beginning with footprints made in the sand by humankind&#x2019;s earliest ancestors, he takes us via Romans and Vikings, the flowering of religion, through civil war, industrial revolution and two world wars. From windswept headlands to battlefields, ancient trees to magnificent cathedrals, each of his destinations is a place where, somehow, the spirit of the past seems to linger.</p><p>Neil Oliver was born in Renfrewshire in Scotland. He studied archaeology at the University of Glasgow and worked as an archaeologist before training as a journalist. In 2002 he made his television debut presenting BBC2&#x2019;s Two Men in a Trench in which he and Tony Pollard visited historic British battlefields. Since that time he has been a regular on TV, presenting A History of Scotland, Vikings, and Coast. He was appointed President of the National Trust in Scotland in 2017. He travels all the time, but his home is in Stirling, with his wife, three children and an Irish wolfhound."A collection of highly crafted historical-archaeological microessays, each centred on a significant place in Britain or Ireland. Few popular history books are as pleasingly tactile as this one..a vivid, pungent history" - James McConnachie - TLS<br><br>"This book brilliantly demonstrates Neil's mastery of the broad sweep of British history and landscape." - Dan Snow -<br><br>"Everyone should have two copies &#x2013; one for the car and one for the house to plan journeys. It&#x2019;s a robust rebuke to the satnav &#x2013; a reminder to think more about the places you pass and less about your route, because every British journey is through rich history." - Edward Stourton -<br><br>"Neil Oliver brings his vast experience and expertise to bear on this deeply personal journey into British history - a wonderful read." - Alice Roberts -<br><br>"In his introduction Neil Oliver calls the British &#x2018;a lucky, blessed people&#x2019;, and his book holds up a mirror to that national self-image. Oliver&#x2019;s timeline journey travels from prehistoric footprints off the Norfolk coast to the Ozymandias folly of the Millennium Dome, from a tiny, exquisite jewel crafted for King Alfred the Great to great enigmatic stone forts in the West of Ireland that are being eaten by the sea. Stories we have been telling ourselves for thousands of years are falling on deaf ears or being forgotten, says Oliver. Here in a hundred fascinating doses is the antidote to that millennial malaise." - Christopher Somerville, The Times walking correspondent, author of The January Man -</p><h2>Ireland Ever: The Photographs of Jill Freedman</h2><p>A photographic portrait of the Irish landscape and its people commemorates traditional regional life with a range of duotone photographs, complemented with texts by best-selling Irish-American authors including Angela&#39;s Ashes&#39;s Frank McCourt and Singing My Him Song&#39;s, Malachy McCourt. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>Jill Freedman is a highly respected documentary photographer whose award-winning work is included in the permanent collections of The Museum of Modern Art, the International Center of Photography, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Biblioth�que Nationale. She lives in East Hampton, New York.For a country so identified with the color green, it seems odd to photograph Ireland in black and white. Freedman&#x2019;s approach, however, brings out the spirit of the Irish people and landscape in less familiar ways. The stone cliffs and walls of The Burren in County Clare spread solidly over two pages, and a robust man sets off rowing under a darkened sky in Dingle. In her prefatory note, Freedman says she tries to get away from "the ugly, noisy modern world" when she visits Ireland, and instead seeks out people living as they have for ages. To this end, she photographs scenes such as an elderly man journeying with his mule and dogs in County Leitrim, a man giving his pony a sip of Guinness and a small boy leading cows up a road in County Kerry. Earlier in her life Freedman was a musician, and she clearly still loves music makers: the book includes several striking pictures of old men playing their pipes in solitude and many more of fiddlers and accordionists. Other standbys of Irish life&#x2014;pubs, the Catholic Church, hunting&#x2014;are present, but in an unobtrusive, unconventional way. A few photos (a trio of mud wrestlers; a group of college lads with their pants around their ankles) briefly take the book away from Freedman&#x2019;s romantic rural vision, but for the most part, she succeeds in presenting a photo-journal that lovingly captures the enduring aspects of Irish tradition. 90 duotone photos.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Herzog loses his gloves and the two barely reach camp with dead hands and feet. This is also the point where Herzog's tale falls apart, writes David Roberts, and it has taken nearly 50 years to uncover the real story behind the nationalist-tinged French expedition in 1950. Roberts, himself a climber of some accomplishment who admits to worshipping the heroics of the Annapurna team as a youth, traveled around the world interviewing friends and family of the team members (all deceased, save for Herzog), and chasing down original manuscripts and diaries of the three team members to get the story straight. His findings do not reveal the fearless, selfless leader Herzog painted himself to be in his famous book and subsequent writings. <p> Roberts reconstructs the trip to Annapurna beginning on the Heathrow runway: as the widowed Francoise Rebuffat recalls, Herzog required his highly experienced teammates--Louis Lachenal, Lionel Terray, and Gaston Rebuffat--to sign a contract that granted him full leadership of the expedition, along with rights to publish any and all accounts of the trip for five years following their return. Conflicting stories to Herzog's "official" account begin from that moment. Herzog writes of his team's indefatigable support and loyalty to their leader, but in reality discord nearly crippled the success of the climb. In order to preserve the reputation he built for himself in <i>Annapurna</i>, Herzog, throughout his life, censored any account of the trip authored by the other team members, even "editing" Lachenal's posthumously published climbing memoir, <i>Carnets de Vertige</i>. </p><p> While the dissection of Herzog's ego here is expected, Roberts discovers that none of his heroes are what he thought they were. "More rounded," he surmises, and ultimately better for it. Equal parts memoir, climbing lore, investigative journalism, and biography, Roberts provides the missing dimensions of the climb and the three extraordinary climber's lives--Lachenal, Terray, and Rebuffat--that Herzog so tirelessly strove to conceal. <i>--Lolly Merrell</i></p><b>David Roberts</b> is a veteran mountaineer with extensive experience in Alaska and the author of a dozen previous books.

As the highest-ranking military defector to the U.S., he is in a unique position to detail the intelligence aspect of the cold war and the emergence of the Russian mafia as a threat to national security. <p> <i>Through the Eyes of the Enemy</i> is more than the autobiography of a highly skilled intelligence operative and defector; it is a "debriefing" on the new cold war being waged by the Russian mafia against American corporations. Lunev portrays organized crime as the only authority in modern Russia, and asserts that this element has infiltrated every level of American private and corporate life. He provides chilling details of seismic weapons, mass-scale corporate espionage, and deep-cover death squads. <i>Through the Eyes of the Enemy</i> could be dismissed as fantastic paranoid ravings were the source not so credible and the ramifications not so severe. <i>--Brendan J.

Three Decades of Hiphop Photography</h2><p><p>Nearly thirty years ago, Ernie Paniccioli began photographing the graffiti art throughout New York City as well as the young people creating it. Armed with a 35-millimeter camera, Paniccioli literally recorded the beginning salvos of hip hop, today the most dominant youth culture on the planet. Be it Grandmaster Flash at the Roxy, a summer block party in the Bronx, the fresh faces of Queen Latifah and Will Smith, the cocksure personas of Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., and Emimem, or the regal grace of Lauryn Hill, Ernie Paniccioli has been there to showcase hip hop's evolution much in the same way Gordon Parks recorded the Civil Rights Movement, or akin to the manner in which James Van Der Zee, the great photographer of Harlem in the 1920s, met the energy and spirit of his times.</p><p><em>Who Shot Ya? Three Decades of Hip Hop Photography</em> is the first major pictorial history of hip hop culture based around the work of one photographer.

The Language of Fashion brings together all Barthes&#39; untranslated writings on fashion.The Language of Fashion presents a set of remarkable essays, revealing the breadth and insight of Barthes&#39; long engagement with the history of clothes. The essays range from closely argued essays laying down the foundations for a structural and semiological analysis of clothing to a critical analysis of the significance of gemstones and jewellery, from an exploration of how the contrasting styles of Courrges and Chanel replayed the clash between ancient and modern to a discussion of the meaning of hippy style in Morocco, and from the nature of desire to the role of the dandy and colour in fashion.Constantly questioning, always changing, Barthes&#39; ideas about clothes and fashion remain to provoke another generation of readers seeking to understand not only the culture of fashion but the fashion of culture.</p><p><p>Roland Barthes changed the way a generation read. A cultural commentator before his time, his careful if playful analysis of texts revolutionised the way we comprehend cultural products. Both critic and literary essayist, his writings continue to provoke. His best known work includes Mythologies, Camera Lucida, Image-Music-Text, The Empire of Signs, A Lover's Discourse, Writing Degree Zero, S/Z and The Fashion System.</p><p>Translated by Andy Stafford, Senior Lecturer in French Studies, University of Leeds and edited by Andy Stafford and Michael Carter, Department of Art History and Theory, University of Sydney.</p>As part of his edgy 1960s cultural criticism, French sociologist Barthes wrote extensively on fashion, culminating in <i>The Fashion System</i>. British academics Stafford and Michael Carter have assembled a smattering of the early interdisciplinary essays that haven't been translated before, originally published in publications as diverse as <i>Revue Fran�aise de Sociologie</i> and <i>Marie Claire</i>. The essays reveal the chronological development of Barthes's thinking, from 1957 to 1969, which essentially aimed to apply Saussure's semiology to clothing forms to show how "the signifying function of dress makes it a total social object." In the early "History and Sociology of Clothing," for example, Barthes equates the Saussurian linguistics distinctions "langue" and "parole" to fashion; that is, "langue" is dress, while "parole" is the act of getting dressed. "Language and Clothing" delves into fashion history, extracting the nugget that men's current anti-dandyist style derives from the austerity of Quaker dress. "From Gemstones to Jewellery" is one of the few essays for lay readers, as is a consideration of classic versus modern style entitled "The Contest Between Chanel and Courr�ges." There's a lot of padding and explication in this slender volume, necessary to navigate Barthes's fairly difficult system. <i>(Apr. 5)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The beginning of God&#39;s story of his interactions with humanity is found in the very first words of the Bible. In the beginning God created. From the start God was present. He was at work. However, in the freshness of a new world where the first man and woman walked and talked with God, sin slithered in, marring creation forever. But the God who hung every star in place and laid every grain of sand upon the shore had, from the beginning, a plan. The whole of Scripture, and indeed the whole of history, is unveiled within the seeds of Genesis. It will be many years before we see the fruit of those seeds, but they are not years of dormancy. Throughout the world and within individual lives, God is actively working to redeem his creation. In Genesis we see him form covenants, bestow blessings, test faithfulness and turn evil intentions into a greater good---all for the purpose of one day redeeming the people he created in his image. It&#39;s a work that will continue until the end of time, but the beginnings for all of it are found in Genesis. The Beginning 1 In the be ginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 Now the earth was a form less and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. 3 And God said, &#39;Let there be light,&#39; and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called t he light &#39;day,&#39; and the darkness he called &#39;night.&#39; And there was evening, and there was morning---the first day. 6 And God said, &#39;Let there be an expanse between the waters to sep a rate water from water.&#39; 7 So God made the expanse and a 2 Or possibly became 1 Author: Moses. Audience: The people of Israel. Date: Between 1446 and 1406 B.C. Setting: The area called the Middle East today. Verse to Remember: In the beginning God . . . (1:1) 13 LOUIS SULLIVAN, the inventor of the modern skyscraper, said, &#39;The tall building . . . should be a proud and soaring thing that makes a powerful appeal to the architectural imagination.&#39; Today, many women embody the same spirit of pride and selfsuffi ciency that is represented in the lofty towers that make up our cities. We focus on personal perfection. Many women seek the pinnacle of age-defying beauty through creams, procedures or surgeries. Some become obsessed with fashion or feel that they must conform to some media-driven image. Over time, it becomes easier and easier to build monuments to ourselves. After all, as the famous ad says, &#39;I&#39;m worth it.&#39; The builders of the tower of Babel shared a key aspect of Sullivan&#39;s vision of the tall building: pride. And they had one purpose: to build a name for themselves. They wanted to claim glory that rightly belonged to God---after all, they were worth it. The longing to climb higher than God didn&#39;t begin in Babel. Before time began Lucifer said, &#39;I will raise my throne above the stars of God&#39; (Isaiah 14:13). It didn&#39;t end with Babel, either. The pyramids of Egypt proclaim the power of the rulers buried beneath them. Many lives were lost in the building of the pyramids, &#39;collateral damage&#39; to the princes who built them. Often Egyptian slaves were killed when their masters died and were buried alongside them. But just as the Egyptian kings sacrificed everything to their own legacy, women often sacrifice the good of those around them for fleeting recognition, not to mention the humble spirit God desires. The rulers of ancient Egypt were not all-powerful---they died the deaths of mere men. Don&#39;t be deceived, your soul will not be saved by flawless skin or the perfect career any more than the towering mountains of stone raised over the mummies of kings saved them. What do you take pride in? What keeps you from glorifying God? Has your focus become self-absorbed? Have you become self-glorifying? The solution is simple: Whatever is keeping you from God, give it to him for his glory. Let your relationship with Jesus be the source of your significance. When you humble yourself before God, you&#39;ll be lifted up. Reaching for the Heavens R e a d : G e n e s i s 1 1 : 1 -- 9 Genesis 11:4 &#39;Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.&#39; reflection 1Name some of the towers you see others building around you that take glory away from God.

How could everyone in a castle--even the flies on the walls--sleep for a century and then wake up? This magical, beautifully illustrated tale begins when the king excludes the most difficult fairy of the kingdom from a feast celebrating the birth of his beautiful daughter Briar Rose. Furious, the fairy storms in and curses the baby, pronouncing that on her fifteenth birthday she will be pricked by a distaff (from a spinning wheel) and fall down dead. The youngest fairy softens the curse to a century-long sleep. Despite the fact that the king burns all the spinning wheels in the kingdom, 15-year-old Briar Rose finds herself in the tower where the evil fairy and her fate await her. The drama of the spell unfurls as she and the other inhabitants of the castle fall instantly asleep, from courtiers to kitchen maids. Thorny briars--moodily captured by Trina Schart Hyman's masterful paintbrush--grow up around the castle. Hyman depicts those who died attempting to break through the maze of thorns to reach the legendary sleeping beauty in a nightmarish illustration. But goodness and true love prevail when the perfect prince does finally find his way through the thick vines.<p> Hyman won a Caldecott Medal for her work in <i>Saint George and the Dragon</i> by Margaret Hodges, and her version of <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> makes us believe in the magic of the spell. The scenes inside the castle are alive with color and movement and rich with details that children will devour eagerly. Moods and expressions are rendered exquisitely, especially those of the wild, red-haired beauty Briar Rose.

But these wicked wet blankets never counted on someone as clever as Hershel of Ostropol showing up.

By the author of The House of Pain. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>Plunging inexorably toward apocalypse, this expertly layered thriller by the author of The House of Pain darkly foreshadows the forthcoming 2000 presidential elections. Opening in Cuba in 1963, the narrative follows the parallel careers of Cobra, a young Rhodesian sharpshooter who is sent by Castro to Dallas to assassinate JFK, and Rupert Justice Tolliver, a young Texan on the same Dallas flight, who dreams of becoming president. After fulfilling his mission, Cobra ducks his pursuers by joining the U.S. Marines and is sent to Vietnam. Meanwhile, Tolliver enters divinity school to avoid the war and eventually capitalizes on his charisma as a radio/TV evangelist to become governor of Texas. Surviving Vietnam, Cobra returns to Rhodesia and buys a large farm. Over the years, he fights the elements and struggles to keep his land by hiring himself out as a hit man for high pay, all the while following with casual interest the adventures of the sly, Bible-spouting Texan who finally becomes the first U.S. president of the new millennium. Soon after Tolliver is sworn in, a young woman stumbles upon documentation of a shady land deal manipulated to funnel money to Tolliver and his campaign. Meanwhile, once Tolliver takes office, it becomes obvious that the Texan--convinced it is his destiny to fulfill the prophecy of the book of Revelations--is quite mad. With poetic symmetry, a secret group of powerbrokers hires Cobra to execute the ultimate sanction, and the thriller echoes Forsyth's Day of the Jackal as it approaches an adrenaline-charged finale. Though Leib's prose is only workmanlike, his juicy treatment of political chicanery, sexual promiscuity, media hijinks, international intrigue and atomic brinkmanship makes for a gripping read. (Jan.) <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Smartly told thriller by Leib (The House of Pain, 1998) about a presidential assassination and the brilliance of the assassin hired to do the deed. We first meet Cobra, a South African, in the early `60s, preparing to assassinate Castrothough he shoots the cigar out of leaders mouth rather than kill him. Captured, he is sent to Washington to be the second shooter to the unknown primary one who will kill Kennedy in Dealey Plaza. From the grassy knoll, he sees the primary's round go through the president's throat, then he himself shots out Kennedy's brain, drops his Italian rifle down a manhole, and escapes. But his fake passport is too shoddy to get him out of the country, so he joins the Marine Corps and is sent to Vietnam as a top sniper. After two years he's taken prisoner by the North Vietnamese but eventually winds up in South Africa owning his own farm. Meanwhile, in the States, Rupert Justice Tolliver, a fundamentalist preacher whom Cobra met in Mexico City, is on his way to becoming presidentand his wife, Clarissa, makes sure he wins. When Tolliver is elected and world events lead him into a naval standoff with the Russians over Cuba (recalling Kennedy and Krushchev eyeball to eyeball), it's time to assassinate the President and get the world settled down again. So Cobra is hired once more, by whom he never knows. Despite its melodrama, strong on authenticity throughout, especially about the fine points of rifles and assassinations. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Ungainly in stature and awkward in manner, the newly elected Lincoln was considered a Western stump speaker and debater devoid of rhetorical polish. Then, after the outbreak of the Civil War, he stood before the nation to deliver his Message to Congress in Special Session on July 4, 1861, and, as a contemporary editor put it, &#x201c;some of us who doubted were wrong.&#x201d; <br><br>In <i>The Eloquent President,</i> historian Ronald White examines Lincoln&#x2019;s astonishing oratory and explores his growth as a leader, a communicator, and a man of deepening spiritual conviction. Examining a different speech, address, or public letter in each chapter, White tracks the evolution of Lincoln&#x2019;s rhetoric from the measured, lawyerly tones of the First Inaugural, to the imaginative daring of the 1862 Annual Message to Congress, to the haunting, immortal poetry of the Gettysburg Address. <br><br>As a speaker who appealed not to intellect alone, but also to the hearts and souls of citizens, Lincoln persuaded<b> </b>the nation to follow him during the darkest years of the Civil War. Through the speeches and what surrounded them&#x2013;the great battles and political crises, the president&#x2019;s private anguish and despair, the impact of his words on the public, the press, and the nation at war&#x2013;we see the full sweep and meaning of the Lincoln presidency. <br><br>As he weighs the biblical cadences and vigorous parallel structures that make Lincoln&#x2019;s rhetoric soar, White identifies a passionate religious strain that most historians have overlooked. It is White&#x2019;s contention that as president Lincoln not only grew into an inspiring leader and determined commander in chief, but also embarked on a spiritual odyssey that led to a profound understanding of the relationship between human action and divine will.<br><br>Brilliantly written, boldly original in conception, <i>The Eloquent President </i>blends history, biography, and a deep intuitive appreciation for the quality of Lincoln&#x2019;s extraordinary mind. With grace and insight, White captures the essence of the four most critical years of Lincoln&#x2019;s life and makes the great words live for our time in all their power and beauty.</p><p>RONALD C. WHITE, JR., is the author and editor of seven books, most recently <i>Lincoln&#x2019;s Greatest Speech</i>, which was a <i>Washington Post</i> bestseller, a <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> bestseller, and a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book.

WASHINGTON" <br><br>farewell address at springfield <br><br>february 11, 1861 <br><br>My friends. <br><br>No one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe every thing. Here I have been a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being, who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail. Trusting in Him, who can go with me, and remain with you and be every where for good, let us confidently hope that all will yet be well. To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell. <br><br>Abraham Lincoln arrived at the small brick Great Western Railway station in Springfield on February 11, 1861, prepared to travel to Washington and his inauguration as the sixteenth president of the United States. The day dawned cold and miserable, with intermittent rain dripping from the low-hanging clouds. Parked at the station was the Presidential Special, a train consisting of only two cars, an ordinary passenger coach and a baggage car, standing by to receive the president and his party. Both cars were painted a bright yellow. The grand locomotive-the L. M. Wiley, brasswork gleaming, with its huge balloon stack-hissed at the ready. <br><br>Lincoln had decided beforehand that he would offer no remarks, and the press had been so informed. After the many farewells of recent days, Lincoln believed there was no need for any more words. Newspaperman Henry Villard, a twenty-five-year-old German immigrant posted to Springfield in November by the New York Herald to report on Lincoln's daily activities after his election as president, captured a remarkable scene. "The President elect took his station in the waiting-room, and allowed his friends to pass by him and take his hand for the last time." Villard observed that Lincoln's "face was pale, and quivered with emotion so deep as to render him almost unable to utter a single word." <br><br>The ringing of the engine bell alerted Lincoln that it was time to board the train. Mary Lincoln and the two younger boys, Willie and Tad, had originally planned not to depart for several days. However, Gen. Winfield Scott, general-in-chief of the U.S. Army, had suggested to Lincoln that Mary and the boys leave that evening and meet Lincoln in Indianapolis. General Scott, concerned for the president-elect's security, thought it would be safer for Lincoln if he was surrounded by his family. Robert, the Lincolns' oldest son, would travel with his father from Springfield. <br><br>As Lincoln stepped out onto the platform, he found himself surrounded by a crowd of about one thousand of his fellow citizens. Friends and neighbors crowded the platform and each side of the festively decorated train. These friends and fellow townspeople had come to say their good-byes. Despite his publicly announced intention not to speak, the crowd thronging around the rear platform encouraged their neighbor to offer some remarks. <br><br>Responding to these requests, Lincoln, after entering the second of the two cars, appeared on the rear platform of the train. He removed his beaver hat and asked for silence. He paused, struggling to contain his feelings, gathering himself to give a speech he had not intended to give. <br><br>Before leaving springfield, Abraham Lincoln had already resolved to confine his speaking as president to a few major occasions when he would have adequate time to prepare. In the three months since his election, as the storm clouds of war darkened, he had excused himself again and again from speaking about any of his positions or future policies. He did not want to say something that could be misinterpreted by foe or friend. <br><br>But how could he keep silent on this morning? Caught off guard, Lincoln spoke briefly in an uncharacteristically personal manner to friends and neighbors. Some who were present had known him for twenty years or more. Lincoln would speak only 152 words, but his words touched his audience in Springfield profoundly. In the poignancy of this moment-leaving the place where he had lived for half his life-Lincoln bared his spirit in deeply emotive language. <br><br>His farewell words at Springfield did not remain in Springfield. His remarks were printed in newspapers the next day and in Harper's Weekly Magazine. Citizens in Albany, Fort Wayne, Dover, Trenton, Providence, and countless small cities and towns were eager to know more about this gangly rail splitter from the West who was about to become their president. <br><br>Abraham lincoln had been saying his farewells to family and friends over the past weeks. As the time for their departure drew nearer, Mary Lincoln invited groups of friends to their home. These gatherings included a children's party. She wrote out the invitations to the children, cards that would be cherished by their recipients well into the twentieth century. <br><br>On January 30, Lincoln slipped away from the persistent stream of reporters and office seekers to offer a special good-bye. He traveled by train and by horse and buggy to Farmington, a small remote community in Coles County, in southern Illinois. He wanted to see his aging stepmother, Sarah Bush Lincoln. <br><br>Lincoln's mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln, had died in 1818. Sarah, a widow, had come from Kentucky as Thomas Lincoln's new wife. Her great gift was to bring nurture and order to the whole family. She gave to young Abraham, a boy of ten, love and encouragement. Sarah, now seventy-three, when hearing of her stepson's nomination, feared that if he was elected, something awful would happen to him. <br><br>As he retraced his route to Springfield, Lincoln's stepmother traveled with him as far as Charleston. (In March 1830, a young Lincoln had driven a yoke of oxen pulling one of the wagons in the family move from Spencer County, Indiana, to this area of Illinois.) At an evening reception on January 31, everyone was eager to hear Lincoln speak, but he declined the invitation. Lincoln did join in with reminiscence and stories of his simpler days with folk who had known him since he was barely twenty-one. <br><br>Returning to springfield, Lincoln requested privacy. A notice appeared each day that week in the Illinois State Journal: "The present week being the last that Mr. Lincoln remains at Springfield, and it being indispensable that he should have a portion of time to himself, he will see visitors only at his office, No. 4, Johnson building, from 31?2 to 5 o'clock, P.M., each day." <br><br>Lincoln had to conclude many personal and family matters. He had rented the family home at the northeast corner of Eighth and Jackson Streets to Lucian Tilton, the retired owner of the Wabash Railroad, for $350 a year. The Lincolns sold much of their furniture. They gave their dog, Fido, to a neighbor. Mary burned heaps of old letters and papers in the rear alley. <br><br>A major task was the preparation of his inaugural address. Gov. John Wood had offered Lincoln offices on the second floor in the Illinois State House, in the center of the public square. The governor did not need the offices, as the Illinois state legislature was not in session. Lincoln accepted gladly. He set up an office in the State House and established John G. Nicolay, a former journalist and clerk to the Illinois secretary of state, as his secretary and one-man transition committee. Lincoln knew his dingy law offices would not do as a place to work on his address or to greet visitors. <br><br>Lincoln began his research for his inaugural address shortly after his election. He wanted plenty of time for research, writing, and rewriting. On November 13, only one week to the day after his election, Lincoln borrowed from the Illinois State Library the Statesman's Manual of the Constitution of the United States, volumes I and II. Lincoln refreshed his memory about the nullification controversy of 1832 and President Andrew Jackson's proclamation against nullification. Lincoln was looking for precedents or patterns. He returned the books on December 29. <br><br>Late in December, with the impending convening of the Illinois state legislature on January 7, it became necessary to give up the second-floor space on the southeast corner of the State House. Joel Johnson, owner of an office building, offered Lincoln two offices on the second floor of Johnson's Building, across the street from the Chenery House. <br><br>By January the torrent of old friends, advisers, newspaper reporters, and office seekers pouring into Springfield became relentless. Lincoln could discover no privacy by day or night. These new offices, however, were not the place to work on an inaugural address. <br><br>He next accepted an offer from Clark Moulton Smith, his brother-in-law, to use a room on the third floor of his store as his writing space. Lincoln found the privacy he was seeking, as the room could be entered only through the private office of Smith, in the rear of his storeroom. Here Lincoln closeted himself for the serious work of writing. Day after day he wrote and revised at an old merchant's desk with a slanting front and plenty of pigeonholes. <br><br>Later in January, Lincoln asked William H. Herndon, his law partner, to supply him with copies of two speeches he much admired. Lincoln had first read Daniel Webster's "Reply to Robert Hayne" when he was a young man living in New Salem.

Reports of strange activities at the scene of the crime circulated soon after. When the police arrived, was the head of Paramount Studios burning a bundle of papers in the fireplace, and was a well-known actress searching the house for letters she claimed were hers? Despite a full-scale investigation, the case was never solved; for sixty years is has remained a lingering Hollywood scandal. In 1967, more than forty years after Taylor&#39;s death, the great King Vidor, whose directing credits include Northwest Passage, The Fountainhead, Duel in the Sun, and War and Peace, determined to solve the mystery, which had haunted him throughout his career, in order to make a film about it. Through his intimate knowledge of both the studios and the stars, he succeeded, where dozens of professional detectives had failed, in discovering the identity of the murderer. But because his findings were so explosive, he decided he could never go public and locked his evidence away. After Vidor&#39;s death in 1982, Sidney D. Kirkpatrick, Vidor&#39;s authorized biographer, gained access to the evidence and reconstructed the amazing story of Taylor&#39;s murder and Vidor&#39;s investigation. With a cast of suspects that includes the actress Mabel Normand, a reputed drug addict; the beautiful ing�nue, Mary Miles Minter; Mary&#39;s domineering mother, Charlotte Shelby; Taylor&#39;s homosexual houseman; and Taylor&#39;s secretary, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Taylor&#39;s mysteriously elusive brother, this true crime story has all the elements of a classic murder mystery. Covered up for more than half a century, the full story can now be told in all its riveting, shocking detail.</p><p>As he was researching his "official" biography of King Vidor, the late film director, Kirkpatrick made the discovery on which this true crime story is built. Vidor, planning to make a movie about William Desmond Taylor, murdered in 1922, set out to investigate the unsolved crime 45 years later. Taylor had been a famous director of silents and his death was a sensation that ruined the careers of actresses Mary Miles Minter, Mabel Normand (the victim's reputed lovers) and other Hollywood luminaries. Kirkpatrick skillfully leads the reader into Vidor's search as the director studies old files and questions people in the movie colony who remembered those involved in the tragedy. The result is a riveting mystery. In his dramatic reconstruction, Kirkpatrick uncovers Vidor's convincing evidence, never disclosed by the director, that Taylor was killed by the mother of ingenue Minter.

In 1967, the late director King Vidor decided to investigate the mystery in order to make a film about it. (No film resulted.) Kirkpatrick recounts the story of Vidor's sleuthing, which uncovered scandal, corruption, coverups, and, ultimately, Vidor believed, the identity of the killer. This is a well-researched book, breezily related, whose impact is lessened somewhat by digressions into Vidor's personal life. The combination of Hollywood and murder is likely to be popular.

His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was born deaf; she was committed to a psychiatric clinic when Philip was eight. His father, Prince Andrew of Greece, already traumatized by his exile from his home country, promptly shut up the family home and went off to live with his mistress, effectively leaving his young son an orphan.</p><p>Remarkably, Philip emerged from his difficult childhood a character of singular vitality and dash&#x2014;self-confident, opinionated, and devastatingly handsome. Girls fell at his feet, and the princess who would become his wife was smitten from the age of thirteen. Yet alongside his considerable charm and intelligence, the young prince was also prone to volcanic outbursts, which would have profound consequences for his family and the future of the monarchy.</p><p>In this authoritative and wonderfully compelling book, acclaimed biographer Philip Eade brings to vivid life the storm-tossed early years of one of the most fascinating and mysterious members of the royal family.</p></p><p><p>Philip Eade has worked as a criminal barrister, English teacher, and journalist. His first book, <i>Sylvia Queen of the Headhunters</i>, was a runner-up for the Biographers' Club Prize; his second, <i>Prince Philip</i>, became a <i>Sunday Times</i> bestseller. He lives in London.</p><p>ONE</p><p><i>Kings of Greece</i></p><p>Although he has been married for more than sixty years to the most enduringly famous woman in the world, Prince Philip's own origins have remained strangely shrouded in obscurity. 'I don't think anybody thinks I had a father,' he remarked ruefully in the 1970s. 'Most people think that Dickie [Mountbatten] is my father anyway.'1</p><p>The easiest way of understanding Prince Philip's paternal ancestry is to start with his grandfather, King George I of Greece. A dashing figure, seen in photographs sporting a range of spectacular moustaches, King George was born Prince William of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl�cksburg in 1845 in Copenhagen, the younger son of an army officer whose meagre pay meant that his children grew up in comparative poverty. Their home, the Yellow Palace, was not especially palatial, with a front door that led straight on to the pavement,2 their lifestyle scarcely regal, with William's mother doing much of the housework and his sisters sharing a room and making their own clothes. As a family, the Gl�cksburgs were loud and frivolous, informal and uncultured, apt to 'make funny noises and yell if they saw anyone trying to write a letter'.3 They were also distinctly unspoilt and unpretentious, yet within a very short space of time they had 'colonised royal Europe', as one chronicler put it.4</p><p>In 1852, William's father was unexpectedly named as heir to the Danish throne, by virtue of being a godson and distant kinsman of the childless king, although for the time being this made no difference to his income and the family still struggled to make ends meet.5 However, their status changed dramatically in 1863, when, within a year, the father succeeded as King Christian IX of Denmark, William's sister Alexandra married the Prince of Wales, destined to become King Edward VII, and a delegation from Greece came and asked seventeen-year-old William to be their king. Another sister, Dagmar, would shortly marry the future Tsar Alexander III of Russia, while yet another, Thyra, married the heir to the throne of Hanover - although that was soon dissolved by Prussia after the 1866 Anglo-Prussian war. Within the next half-century, the descendants of Christian IX would occupy no fewer than nine European thrones.6 Only the descendants of Queen Victoria were more widely spread.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>King George I, as William became on his accession, later maintained that he had accepted the Greek throne with great reluctance, since it meant abandoning his chosen naval career to go and rule a far-off country with a turbulent people and a language he did not speak.7 Greece had only recently broken free from the Ottoman Empire as a result of the long and bloody war of independence that had claimed the life of Lord Byron among countless others. The new country - unstable, poor and less than half the size of what it was to become during George's reign - was formally recognized by the London Protocol of 1830, in which the protecting powers, France, Great Britain and Russia, stipulated that a hereditary sovereign should be chosen from outside the country to lessen the chances of internal disputes. In 1833 a young Bavarian prince called Otto had arrived in a British frigate to fill this vacancy, but his tactless and despotic rule caused countless insurrections. In 1862 he was deposed in a bloodless revolution and left Greece just as he had arrived, in a British warship.</p><p>Many Greek people had wanted to have as his successor Queen Victoria's second son, Prince Alfred, whose portrait was carried through the streets of Athens by a cheering mob. But Alfred was ineligible as a prince of one of the protecting powers; and besides, his mother did not like the idea. Several alternatives were suggested before eventually they settled on the young Danish prince as the least contentious candidate.</p><p>When he first arrived in Greece, he was still not yet eighteen and as he took the oath to the new constitution at the national assembly, the British ambassador was moved by 'the sight of this slight, delicate stripling, standing alone amidst a crowd of callous, unscrupulous politicians, many of whom had been steeped to the lips in treason, and swearing to observe, as he has so faithfully done, the most unworkable of charters, from which nearly every safeguard had been studiously eliminated'.8</p><p>Athens then was no more than a collection of villages, with a combined population of about 45,000, and the young king developed an endearing habit of walking alone through the streets, stopping every now and then to talk to passers-by. So determined was he to master the Greek language and customs that over the next four years he never left the country, travelling instead to all corners of his realm by ship, carriage, mule and on foot.</p><p>While he never entirely lost his slight Danish accent, King George's enthusiasm and lack of affectation were greatly appreciated by the Greek people. On Monday mornings, he was available to any of his subjects who wanted to come and air their grievances. He also gave an audience to any foreigner who requested one, provided they put on dress-clothes and white tie. The king tended to stand throughout these interviews and one of those who paid a visit, E. F. Benson, was disconcerted by his habit of continuously rising on his toes and rocking back on his heels. Benson found this 'as infectious as yawning' and it was only with the greatest effort that he could prevent himself from following the royal example. Aspirational American ladies began flocking to Athens because, as one of them remarked, 'The royal family of Greece is the easiest royal family to become acquainted with'.9</p><p>Affable and approachable the young King George may have been, but he still had to learn to stand up for himself against his wily ministers. Shortly after his arrival, a story was told of one cabinet meeting at which the boy king stood up and went over to a map to illustrate a point he was making. When he returned to his seat he noticed that his watch was missing. He looked around the table: 'Will whoever has my watch please return it?' he demanded. His ministers stared blankly back at him. 'Well, gentlemen,' the king continued, 'I'm not accustomed to this type of joke. I'd like to have my watch back.' Still nobody spoke. Adopting a sterner tone, the king announced that he was going to put out the light and count to sixty. 'If I find the watch again on the table, the incident will be closed,' he said. In the darkness he called the seconds out loud. When he turned the lights back on his silver inkstand had vanished as well.10</p><p>Apart from dealing with his ministers and frequent changes of government (forty-two in the first twenty-five years of his reign), he also had to re-establish the rather ramshackle court, train his own aides-de-camp, butlers, footmen and so forth, and set the appropriate tone, although to begin with his youthful demeanour made it 'sometimes difficult for his daily companions to maintain the respectful reserve and gravity due to a royal station'.11 The young king was also regularly reminded by his counsellors of his dynastic responsibilities, to marry and produce a son born on Greek soil, and so in 1867, aged twenty-one, he visited his sister in Russia, where he hoped to find a wife.</p><p>Tsar Alexander II had persuaded George that his was the only country where he would find a girl with the requisite combination of royal breeding and Orthodox faith. The two-month trip would also enable him to see how the vast empire was run. He lost no time as regards his primary purpose and on a visit to the tsar's younger brother Constantine at Pavlovsk he promptly proposed to the Grand Duke's fifteen-year-old daughter Olga, a shy and pretty girl with beautiful dark eyes, whom Queen Victoria had thought might do rather well for her son Alfred.12 Engaged within a week of meeting, they were married shortly after her sixteenth birthday in an elaborate five-day ceremony at the Winter Palace.</p><p>For her arrival in Athens, Queen Olga thoughtfully wore a dress in the Greek national colours of blue and white which delighted the huge crowd and her 'fresh young beauty' soon won the hearts of her subjects.13 With her came a Russian lady-in-waiting, a governess and a trunk full of dolls and teddy bears to complete the entourage. At times overwhelmed and frightened by the reception she received, the young queen was once found hiding beneath the palace staircase 'hugging her favourite Russian stuffed bear, and weeping bitterly'.14 She never did entirely overcome her homesickness - whenever a Russian ship docked at Piraeus, she could scarcely keep away from it - but the marriage was extremely successful and as queen she won the enduring love of the Greek people.</p><p>Olga's first child, a son, was born barely nine months after the wedding and named Constantine after the last emperor of Byzantine Greece, an augury which prompted much rejoicing. She went on to have a further seven children, three girls (one of whom survived only three months) and four more boys. Philip's father, Andrew, known as Andrea, was the last but one, born in 1882 at Tato�, the royal family's country estate, some thirty miles north of Athens. He was premature and so tiny that he spent his first few days in a cigar box being fed with a toothpick,15 however after being wet-nursed by a 'pleasant-looking peasant from the island of Andros, called Athena',16 he eventually grew into a tall and athletic figure, 'like a thoroughbred horse' according to Philip's aunt Marie Bonaparte.17 By common consent he was the most handsome of the king's sons. It was from him that Philip inherited his high-domed forehead, his 'fine nose and lips and the narrow Mountbatten eyes' coming from his mother.18</p><p>Andrea grew up with his brothers and sisters at the gaunt royal palace which had been built by King Otto on a hill overlooking old Athens and was extensively ransacked after his departure. Nowadays used as the Greek parliament, during Andrea's childhood it was an 'excessively uncomfortable' family home, so his younger brother Christopher recalled, with only one bathroom where the taps emitted a dismal trickle of water and the odd defunct cockroach.19 As a boy, Andrea suffered at least one bout of typhoid, presumed to have been caught from the palace drains.</p><p>Winters were especially spartan, with cold winds whistling through the long, dim galleries and countless unused rooms. King George seems to have grown sterner with fatherhood and whatever the weather bade his sons get up at six each morning for a cold bath and then lessons at 6.30 sharp. His sister Alexandra, who came to visit in 1893, when Andrea was eleven, noted that the king was 'rather tyrannical in the family' and failed to take his children into his confidence even when they grew up, which embittered them towards him.20 However, he would occasionally unbend to lead bicycling or rollerskating processions around the palace with the whole family following in order of age.</p><p>He told his children: 'You must never forget that you are foreigners in this country, but you must make them [the Greek people] forget it.'21 The eldest children spoke Greek to each other at home and English to their parents, who in turn conversed in German. Andrea was always more Greek than any of his siblings and as a boy flatly refused to speak any other language.22</p><p>Although George liked discipline and uniforms, he was in other respects a relatively down-to-earth monarch, and the atmosphere at his court was generally far more relaxed than elsewhere in Europe. The princes and princesses were known by their Christian names alone and often hailed as such in the street. They all grew up with a love of practical jokes. 'Anything could happen when you got a few of them together,' according to Philip. 'It was like the Marx brothers.'23</p><p>Court balls were notably democratic. A foreign guest once hired a carriage to drive him to the palace for one of these parties, only for his coachman to stipulate: 'Do you mind going rather early, because I'm going there myself and shall have to go home and change?' The foreign gentleman laughed at what he thought was a rather good joke; but later in the evening, there was his driver, resplendent in evening clothes, dancing with the wife of a minister.24</p><p>There was a fairy-tale quality to the whole set-up. When E. F. Benson visited in 1893 he recorded that on Sunday afternoons a small compartment was often reserved on the steam tram that ran between Athens and the coast at Phaleron; when it stopped opposite the palace, the king and his family would emerge to the sound of a bugler. If they failed to come at once, the driver would impatiently touch the whistle. Benson found Greece to be an </p><br><p></p><p>astonishing little kingdom, the like of which, outside pure fiction, will never again exist in Europe ... its army dressed in Albanian costume (embroidered jacket, fustinella, like a ballet skirt, fez, white gaiters, red shoes with tassels on the toes like the seeds of dandelions), its fleet of three small cruisers, its national assembly of bawling Levantines and its boot-blacks called Agamemnon and Thucydides, was precisely like the fabulous kingdom of Paflagonia in <i>The Rose and the Ring</i>, or some Gilbertian realm of light opera.25</p><p></p><br><p>Every other summer the family would travel to Denmark, where King Christian IX and his wife Queen Louise had their descendants to stay en masse at the vast Fredensborg Palace. With all the court attendants and personal servants, the house parties numbered up to three hundred, and apart from the Greek royal family, included the Prince and Princess of Wales and Tsar Alexander III and Tsarina Marie Feodorovna (as King George's sister Dagmar had now become). Court etiquette was dispensed with during the day, when the tsar would take the children off to catch tadpoles or steal apples, but for dinner they all entered the big hall in a long procession arm in arm, preceded by the tsar, who offered his arm to Queen Louise, and the rest following according to rank.</p><p>There were also regular trips to Russia - across the Black Sea to Sebastopol where the luxurious imperial train awaited - and to Corfu, one of the Ionian islands given to Greece by Britain on George's accession to the throne, and where the municipality had presented the new king with a villa, Mon Repos, on a promontory just to the south of Corfu Town. But most of their time away from Athens was spent at Tato�, Andrea's birthplace, the royal estate of 40,000 acres in the pine-scented foothills of Mount Parn�s, high enough to be much cooler than the capital. After buying Tato� in 1871, King George had established a vineyard to produce an alternative to the pine-infused retsina, which he detested, and a butter-making dairy farm with a range of Danish-style stone buildings.

This is the story of those individuals and their response to wars from the first peacetime American draft in 1940 to the Continental Walk for Disarmament and Social Justice in 1976. One student, writing in the college newspaper in 1969 during the turbulent Vietnam era, recognized something extraordinary in the teaching and example he found when he said, &#34;We are fortunate to have a campus where adult leadership is as principled as it is here. There are staff members whose records or opposition to war started long before the Vietnam War made such opposition respectable. The rest of the country unfortunately cannot claim such ethical leadership.&#34; The lives of the quiet peacemakers of Wilmington College represent a powerful example of resistance to war, and their work challenges the notion that violence can ever be justifed.</p><p></p><h2>The Age of Jackson</h2><p>This volume, by the great American historian Arthur M.

His novel Cyber Way won the Southwest Book Award for Fiction in 1990, the first science fiction work ever to do so.<b> </b>Foster and his wife, JoAnn Oxley, live in Prescott, Arizona, in a house built of brick that was salvaged from an early-twentieth-century miners&#x2019; brothel. He is currently at work on several new novels and media projects.At first thought, you'd think it would be easy to find a missing planet. Even a methane dwarf. Except that the missing tenth world of the outlying Imperial AAnn system of Pyrassis was not a world, but an immense automated weapons platform of the long-extinct race who called themselves the Tar-Aiym.<br><br> Actually, Flinx mused as he held out his arms and let the magnetically charged droplets of water swirl around him and scrub his lanky naked form, one would think it would be even simpler to find a planet-sized weapons platform than a small planet itself. The only problem was that in the absence of standing orders to guide its revived behavior, the monstrous ancient device had gone looking for some. Since to the best of current knowledge the last of those beings who might be capable of issuing such directives had died half a million years earlier, more or less, the prospects of said intelligent weapons platform stumbling across relevant instructions on how it ought to proceed were slight indeed. Flinx suspected that it would do no good, should he somehow actually succeed in tracking down his galactically perambulating quarry, to point out that the species it was built to fight, the Hur'rikku, were as dead and gone as the massive machine's original Tar-Aiym builders.<br><br> Find it first, he told himself as he did a slow turn beneath the recycled spray from the shower. Semantics follow function.<br><br> He did not need to pivot for purposes of cleanliness since the water beads automatically enveloped him in their attentive aqueous embrace. They avoided only the special shower mask that shielded his mouth and nose. Without such a mask, someone making use of such a shower conceivably could drown--though it was an easy enough matter simply to step sideways and clear of the open-sided, freestanding facility.<br><br> "Are you finished yet?" The voice of the Teacher's ship-mind reached him through the stimulating vertical bath.<br><br> "Almost. Why? Are you going to suggest that after I finish bathing I take another 'vacation'?"<br><br> "It is interesting how sardonicism tends to shed efficacy over time," the ship-mind replied tartly. Having suggested that Flinx spend a while resting and recuperating on the out-of-the-way world of Jast, only to see him nearly murdered by one of the expatriate AAnn officials residing on that world, the AI was understandably disinclined to discuss the subject. Knowing this, Flinx lost few opportunities to bring it up.<br><br> "I take your point, by which I assume that you're not going to make such a suggestion. Good."<br><br> As he stepped out of the shower, the ready and waiting dryer scanned his dripping body. Preprogrammed to his specified level of individual comfort, it set about evaporating from his skin the water and the dirt it had englobed. Standing there, alone in his personal hygienic facilities within the ship, Flinx contemplated his immediate future and regarded it as fraught with uncertainty, danger, and confusion.<br><br> Not that it had ever been otherwise.<br><br> Some days he chose to dress while at other times he moved about the Teacher's interior quite naked. As the only human on board, there was no need to concern himself with violating nudity taboos. Pip certainly did not mind. Rising from the resting place where she had dozed in utter indifference to her master's peculiar habit of immersing himself in gravity-defying liquid, she landed on his bare right shoulder and settled down. Her slender serpentine shape was warm against his freshly scoured skin.<br><br> Pulling on lightweight pants and a feathery comfort shirt, he made his way to the Teacher's bridge. Around him, the product of the Ulru-Ujurrian's creative engineering genius functioned smoothly. It would have been dead silent inside the ship, except that dead silence smacked too much of death itself. So at present, and in response to his latest request, the hush was broken by the soft sounds of a Sek-takenabdel cantata. Like many of his kind, Flinx was quite fond of the often atonal yet oddly soothing traditional thranx music, which in this particular composition sounded like nothing less than lullabies sung by angry, but muted, electrified cimbaloms.<br><br> As the ship sped at unnatural velocity through the nebulosity of higher mathematics colloquially known as space-plus, Flinx settled into the single command chair to gaze moodily through the sweeping, curved forward port. Though shifted over into the ultraviolet by the ship's KK-drive posigravity field, the view of the distorted universe surrounding him was, as always, still spectacularly beautiful. Pulsars and novae illuminated nebulae while distant galaxies vied for prominence with nearby suns.<br><br> Meanwhile, out beyond it all, in the direction of the constellation Bootes, something unimaginably vast and malevolent was coming out of a region known as the Great Emptiness, threatening not merely the Commonwealth and civilization, but everything within his field of view. His mental field of view, he reminded himself. Hence the need, however hopeless the notion of fighting something so immense and alien, to find allies. Such as, just possibly, the primeval weapons platform that had for millennia masqueraded as the tenth planet of the system known as Pyrassis.<br><br> Thinking of it made him want to go stand and soak beneath another shower.<br><br> A reaction as ineffectual as it was childish, he knew. He could no more wash away the distinct memory of the evil he knew was out there than he could that of his troubled childhood, his subsequent erratic maturation, and the pressure to succeed that had been placed on him by his good friends and mentors Bran Tse-Mallory and the Eint Truzenzuzex. Just as with his unstable, if escalating and potentially fatal Talent, he could not wish such things away.<br><br> He stared out at the universe and the universe stared right back, indifferent. Exactly how was he supposed to go about finding the wandering planet-sized Tar-Aiym device? The brilliant Truzenzuzex and the insightful Tse-Mallory had been unable to give him much advice. Since he was the only one who had experienced (or suffered, he corrected himself) mental contact with the machine, it was hoped that if he deliberately went looking for it he might make such contact with it again. Strike up a casual conversation with an all-powerful alien artifact, it was supposed.<br><br> And, he mused, in the unlikely event that he did? How to convince such a relic to participate in the defense of the galaxy. Nothing of overweening importance--just your average galaxy, in which he, and everyone he knew, happened to live. Reposing in the chair, he shook his head dolefully though there were none present to note the gesture save Pip and ship.<br><br> "I don't see how I can do what Bran and Tru asked," he muttered aloud. He did not need to explain himself. Ship-mind knew.<br><br> "If you cannot, then no one can," it replied unhelpfully. As befitted its programming, it was doing its best to be supportive.<br><br> "A distinct and even likely possibility," he murmured to no one and nothing in particular. He glanced in the direction of the main readout. "We're still on course--if you can call heading in a general direction hundreds of parsecs in extent a 'course.'"<br><br> As usual, the Teacher sounded more relaxed when responding to specifics of ship operation than it did when trying to understand the often unfathomable complexities of human thought and behavior.<br><br> "We have re-entered the Commonwealth on intent to cross vector three-five-four, accelerating in space-plus on course to leave Commonwealth boundaries beyond Almaggee space, subsequent to entering the Sagittarius Arm and the region collectively known as the Blight."<br><br> The Blight, Flinx thought. Home to long-vanished species among whom were the ancient Tar-Aiym and Hur'rikku. The Blight: an immense swath of space once flourishing with inhabited worlds much of which had been rendered dead and sterile by the photonic plague unleashed by the Tar-Aiym on their ancient Hur'rikku enemies half a million years ago. Like those who had hastily and unwisely propounded it, the all-destroying plague had long since consumed itself, leaving in its wake only empty skies gazing forlornly down on dead worlds. Here and there, in a few spatial corners miraculously passed over by the plague, life had survived. Life, and memories of the all-consuming horror that had inexplicably skipped over them. No wonder the inhabitants of such isolated yet fortunate systems gazed up at the night sky with fear instead of expectation, and clung tightly to their isolated home systems.<br><br> Somewhere within that immense and largely vacant chunk of cosmos, the re-energized Tar-Aiym weapons platform had gone searching for instructions. Hunting for those who had made it. That there were none such to be found anywhere any longer was not sufficient to discourage it from looking. Such was the way of the machine mind. A mind he somehow had to make contact with once again. A mind he had somehow to persuade.<br><br> A hard task it was going to be, if he continued to have trouble convincing himself that the enterprise he was engaged in had not even the remotest chance of success.<br><br> When applied to most people, the expression have an open mind was merely rhetorical. Not so with Flinx. In fact, for much of his life he had prayed for the ability to have one that was closed. Intermittently and uncontrollably exposed to the emotions of any and every sentient around him, he threatened to drown in a sea of sentiment and sensation whenever he visited a developed world. Feelings flooded in on him in endless waves of exhilaration, despair, hope, remorse, anger, love, and everythi...</p><h2>Birth and Relationships: How Your Birth Affects Your Relationships</h2><p>Argues that the way a person was born, normal, cesarian, premature, etc., affects one&#39;s personal relationships, and discusses separation anxiety</p><p></p><h2>Say Something: 10th Anniversary Edition</h2><p><p><strong>At this school, there are some children who push and tease and bully.

Beginning with the creation of the universe and ending with the death and deification of Julius Caesar, Ovid&#x2019;s masterful epic poem features a rich assortment of tales, including those of Jason and the Argonauts, Orpheus and Eurydice, the Trojan War, Echo and Narcissus, the slaying of the Minotaur, Daedalus and Icarus, Hercules, Aeneas and Dido, the wedding of Perseus and Andromeda, and many others. These stories all have one element in common: transformation. Mortals become gods, animals turn to stone, and humans change into flowers, trees, or stars. Mingling pathos, humor, beauty, and cruelty, Ovid reveals how the endless ebb and flow of the universe itself is mirrored in the often paradoxical and always arbitrary fate of the poem&#x2019;s characters, both human and divine.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;RA cosmic comedy of manners, &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RMetamorphoses&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R was read with delight in Ovid&#x2019;s own time and continues to charm audiences today, providing a treasure trove of myth and legend from which the whole of Western art and literature has derived incalculable inspiration.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RRobert Squillace&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R &amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;Rteaches Cultural Foundations courses in the General Studies Program of New York University.

He has published extensively on the field of modern British literature, most notably in his study <i>Modernism, Modernity and Arnold Bennett</i> (Bucknell University Press, 1997).

Squillace also wrote the Introduction and Notes for the Barnes &amp; Noble Classics edition of Homer&#x2019;s <i>Odyssey.</i><br><b>From Robert Squillace&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Metamorphoses<br><br></i></b><p>From today&#x2019;s perspective, Ovid stands almost precisely at the midpoint of literary history; the preservation of language in Egyptian hieroglyphics and Mesopotamian cuneiform began about as many centuries before his lifetime as he himself lived before the era of e-texts and digital printing. While the dating of past history was certainly less precise in Roman times than it is now, from his own vantage point Ovid could see that centuries of written tradition preceded him; indeed, an allusive engagement with previous poetry already marked his Hellenistic forebears. More than any of his other works, the <i>Metamorphoses</i> expresses Ovid&#x2019;s acute sense of the massive accumulation of history and legend, attempting as it does to &#x201c;bring down [its] song in unbroken strains from the world&#x2019;s very beginning even unto the present time.&#x201d; Moreover, the poem is shaped to induce in its readers an experience of peering down vertiginous historical depths. Just as modern works on the history of Earth often note that the arrival of humanity on the planet would correspond, on a twenty-four-hour clock, to just a minute or two before midnight, so Ovid&#x2019;s poem sets foot on the mainland of Italy only in the fourteenth of its fifteen books; further, this epic of universal history reaches the events of Ovid&#x2019;s own lifetime just sixty lines before the end of its final book. Indeed, the poet&#x2019;s consciousness of time would be impossible had centuries of written records not been available to him. When, again in book XV, Ovid has the pre-Socratic philosopher Pythagoras base his perception of the eternal flux of existence on a myriad of such facts as the changing courses of rivers, the erosion of peninsulas into islands, and the gradual decline of once-mighty cities into barren plains, the poet assumes a world in which the permanence of writing makes it possible to know intimately the enormous distance between past and present by the comparison of what is to what texts say had once been. </p><p>In singing the tale of ceaseless change, of course, Ovid implicitly raises the question of his own relevance to readers of a later time. Over the nearly 2,000 years since the appearance of the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, the plan of the poem itself inspires one to ask whether the ceaseless flow of cultural change has left Ovid&#x2019;s magnum opus a bare and sterile field, fit only to furnish material for a kind of archaeological study of what poetry no longer is, to serve as a morgue of dead men&#x2019;s tales? Can a readership so distant from Augustan Rome embrace a work so dependent on its reader&#x2019;s intimacy with Greco-Roman myth&#x2014;with the life of Hercules, the travels of the Argonauts, the course of the Trojan War, the adulteries of Jupiter, and many other stories far less familiar than these to a modern audience&#x2014;that it often alludes only by the slightest gesture, the verbal equivalent of a raised eyebrow, to the main features of these tales, concentrating instead on the microscopic details of what even for Romans were generally their lesser-known episodes? </p><p>While the <i>Metamorphoses</i> may demand more work from a modern reader and more annotation from an editor than a self-contained narrative like the <i>Odyssey</i>, in other ways&#x2014;compared to, say, Homer or Hesiod&#x2014;Ovid stands almost in our midst. The authors of the Greek epics, like the anonymous creators of the Egyptian<i> Book of the Dead</i> or the ancient Near Eastern epic <i>Gilgamesh</i>, lived in a world where the transmission of stories occurred primarily by word of mouth, and such written texts as did exist primarily served the needs of public performance. Even for the playwrights and philosophers of the Athenian &#x201c;golden age&#x201d; of the fifth century B.C.E., the idea of reading a text to oneself was at best peculiar and at worst intellectually suspect&#x2014;Plato in particular thought writing a poor alternative to speech, which sharpened the memory and allowed for a logical exchange of ideas, rather than the mere repetition of the writer&#x2019;s words in the reader&#x2019;s mouth. But Ovid was a writer in something much closer to the modern sense, composing and revising his works with an eye to their reception by a literate audience of private readers&#x2014;indeed, Ovid is one of the earliest writers explicitly to imagine his work being read by women as well as men. Removing the distribution of stories from the public realm, in fact, made them far more available to women, who were often consigned to purely private lives (similarly, many centuries later the rise of the novel, the genre most devoted to the domestic realm, owes itself both to women readers and women writers). Indeed, Roman practices of book distribution are similar enough to ours that classicists commonly refer to the &#x201c;publication&#x201d; of works during this period. The subjects of the Roman empire did not purchase books from stores, but volumens (scrolls) or codices (unbound sheets) from professional copyists; or, more likely, they read them in libraries. Regardless, they consumed them privately, as we do now.</p></p><h2>Tale of the Little Little Old Woman</h2><p>This simple tale tells of a little cat that gets into big trouble.</p><p>Elsa Beskow (1874-1953) is the most popular children&#39;s illustrator in Sweden, where her picture books have been known and loved for over a century.&#39;A classic children&#39;s picturebook...

You might take me for a nursing student or a typist, note the nervous hands, a foot tapping, bitten lip. I looked like nothing special. It&#x2019;s easy for me to imagine this girl, a strange, young and mousy version of me, carrying an anonymous leather purse or eating from a small package of peanuts, rolling each one between her gloved fingers, sucking in her cheeks, staring anxiously out the window. The sunlight in the morning illuminated the thin down on my face, which I tried to cover with pressed powder, a shade too pink for my wan complexion. I was thin, my figure was jagged, my movements pointy and hesitant, my posture stiff. The terrain of my face was heavy with soft, rumbling acne scars blurring whatever delight or madness lay beneath that cold and deadly New England exterior. If I&#x2019;d worn glasses I could have passed for smart, but I was too impatient to be truly smart. You&#x2019;d have expected me to enjoy the stillness of closed rooms, take comfort in dull silence, my gaze moving slowly across paper, walls, heavy curtains, thoughts never shifting from what my eyes identified&#x2014;book, desk, tree, person. But I deplored silence. I deplored stillness. I hated almost everything. I was very unhappy and angry all the time. I tried to control myself, and that only made me more awkward, unhappier, and angrier. I was like Joan of Arc, or Hamlet, but born into the wrong life&#x2014;the life of a nobody, a waif, invisible. There&#x2019;s no better way to say it: I was not myself back then. I was someone else. I was Eileen.</p><p>And back then&#x2014;this was fifty years ago&#x2014;I was a prude. Just look at me. I wore heavy wool skirts that fell past my knees, thick stockings. I always buttoned my jackets and blouses as high as they could go. I wasn&#x2019;t a girl who turned heads. But there was nothing really so wrong or terrible about my appearance. I was young and fine, average, I guess. But at the time I thought I was the worst&#x2014;ugly, disgusting, unfit for the world. In such a state it seemed ridiculous to call attention to myself. I rarely wore jewelry, never perfume, and I didn&#x2019;t paint my nails. For a while I did wear a ring with a little ruby in it. It had belonged to my mother.</p><p>My last days as that angry little Eileen took place in late December, in the brutal cold town where I was born and raised. The snow had fallen for the winter, a good three or four feet of it. It sat staunchly in every front yard, rolled out at the lip of every first-floor windowsill like a flood. During the day, the top layer of snow melted and the slush in the gutters loosened a bit and you remembered that life was joyful from time to time, that the sun did shine. But by afternoon, the sun had disappeared and everything froze all over again, building a glaze on the snow so thick at night it could hold the weight of a full-grown man. Each morning, I threw salt from the bucket by the front door down the narrow path from the porch to the street. Icicles hung from the rafter over the front door, and I stood there imagining them cracking and darting through my breasts, slicing through the thick gristle of my shoulder like bullets or cleaving my brain into pieces. The sidewalk had been shoveled by the next-door neighbors, a family my father distrusted because they were Lutheran and he was Catholic. But he distrusted everyone. He was fearful and crazy the way old drunks get. Those Lutheran neighbors had left a white wicker basket of cellophane-wrapped waxed apples, a box of chocolates, and a bottle of sherry by the front door for Christmas. I remember the card read, &#x201c;Bless you both.&#x201d;</p><p>Who really knew what happened inside the house while I was at work? It was a three-story colonial of brown wood and flaking red trim. I imagine my father sucking down that sherry in the spirit of Christmas, lighting an old cigar on the stove. That&#x2019;s a funny picture. Generally he drank gin. Beer, occasionally. He was a drunk, as I said. He was simple in that way. When something was the matter, he was easy to distract and soothe: I&#x2019;d just hand him a bottle and leave the room. Of course his drinking put a strain on me as a young person. It made me very tense and edgy. That happens when one lives with an alcoholic. My story in this sense is not unique. I&#x2019;ve lived with many alcoholic men over the years, and each has taught me that it is useless to worry, fruitless to ask why, suicide to try to help them. They are who they are, for better and worse. Now I live alone. Happily. Gleefully, even. I&#x2019;m too old to concern myself with other people&#x2019;s affairs. And I no longer waste my time thinking ahead into the future, worrying about things that haven&#x2019;t happened yet. But I worried all the time when I was young, not least of all about my future, and mostly with respect to my father&#x2014;how long he had left to live, what he might do, what I would find when I got home from work each evening.</p><p>Ours was not a very nice home. After my mother died, we never sorted or put her things away, never rearranged anything, and without her to clean it, the house was dirty and dusty and full of useless decorations and crowded with things, things, things everywhere. And yet it felt completely empty. It was like an abandoned home, its owners having fled one night like Jews or gypsies. We didn&#x2019;t use the den or the dining room or the upstairs bedrooms much. Everything just sat there collecting dust, a magazine splayed over the arm of the couch for years, candy dish full of dead ants. I remember it like those photos of homes in the desert ravaged by nuclear testing. I think you can imagine the details for yourself.</p><p>I slept in the attic, on a cot purchased by my father for some summer camping trip he never took a decade earlier. The attic was unfinished, a cold and dusty place I&#x2019;d retreated to when my mother had gotten sick. Sleep in my childhood bedroom, which was next to hers, had been impossible. She had wailed and cried and called my name throughout the night. The attic was quiet. Not much noise traveled up there from the lower floors of the house. My father had an armchair that he&#x2019;d dragged from the den into the kitchen. He slept there. It was the kind of chair that shuttled backward at the pull of a lever, a charming novelty when he&#x2019;d bought it. But the lever no longer worked. The thing had rusted into permanent repose. Everything in the house was like that chair&#x2014;grimy, ruined, and frozen.</p><p>I remember it pleased me that the sun set so early that winter. Under the cover of darkness, I was somewhat comforted. My father, however, was scared of the dark. That may sound like an endearing peculiarity, but it was not. At night he would light the stove and the oven and drink and watch the blue flames whir under the weak overhead light. He was always cold, he said. And yet he barely dressed. This one evening&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll begin my story there&#x2014;I found him sitting barefoot on the stairs, drinking the sherry, the butt of a cigar between his fingers. &#x201c;Poor Eileen,&#x201d; he said sarcastically when I walked through the door. He was very contemptuous of me, found me pathetic and unattractive and had no qualms about saying so. If my daydreams from back then came true, one day I&#x2019;d have found him splayed out at the bottom of the stairs, neck broken but still breathing. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d say with the most bored affect I could muster, peering over his dying body. So I loathed him, yes, but I was very dutiful. It was just the two of us in the house&#x2014;Dad and me. I do have a sister, still alive as far as I know, but we haven&#x2019;t spoken in over fifty years.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Dad,&#x201d; I said, passing him on the stairs.</p><p>He was not a very large man, but he had broad shoulders and long legs, a sort of regal look about him. His thinning gray hair stood up high and bowed over the crown of his head. His face appeared to be decades older than he really was, and bore in it a wide-eyed skepticism and a look of perpetual disapproval. In retrospect he was much like the boys in the prison where I worked&#x2014;sensitive and angry. His hands shook all the time no matter how much he drank. He was always rubbing at his chin, which was red and drawn and wrinkled. He&#x2019;d tug at it the way you&#x2019;d rub the head of a young boy and call him a little rascal. His one regret in life, he said, was that he&#x2019;d never been able to grow a real beard, as though he could have willed it, but he had failed to. He was like that&#x2014;regretful and arrogant and illogical at once. I don&#x2019;t think he ever really loved his children. The wedding band he continued to wear years after her death suggested that he&#x2019;d loved our mother to some degree at least. But I suspect he was incapable of love, real love. He was a cruel character. Imagining his parents beating him as a child is the only path to forgiveness that I have found so far. It isn&#x2019;t perfect, but it does the trick.</p><p>This isn&#x2019;t a story of how awful my father was, let me be clear. Bemoaning his cruelty is not the point of this at all. But I do remember that day on the stairs, how he winced when he turned to look up at me, as though the sight of me made him ill. I stood on the landing, looking down.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going out again,&#x201d; he croaked, &#x201c;to Lardner&#x2019;s.&#x201d; Lardner&#x2019;s was the liquor store across town. He let the empty sherry bottle slip from his fingers and roll down the staircase, step by step.</p><p>I&#x2019;m very reasonable now, peaceful even, but back then I was easily enraged. My father&#x2019;s demands that I do his bidding like a maid, a servant, were constant. But I was not the kind of girl to say no to anyone.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>My father grunted and puffed on the short butt of his cigar.</p><p>When I was disturbed, I took some comfort in attending to my appearance. I was obsessed with the way I looked, in fact. My eyes are small and green, and you wouldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;especially back then&#x2014;have seen much kindness in them. I am not one of those women who try to make people happy all the time. I&#x2019;m not that strategic. If you&#x2019;d seen me back then with a barrette in my hair, my mousy gray wool coat, you&#x2019;d have expected me to be just a minor character in this saga&#x2014;conscientious, even-tempered, dull, irrelevant. I looked like a shy and gentle soul from afar, and sometimes I wished I was one. But I cursed and blushed and broke out in sweats quite often, and that day I slammed the bathroom door shut by kicking it with the full sole of my shoe, nearly busting the hinges. I looked so boring, lifeless, immune and unaffected, but in truth I was always furious, seething, my thoughts racing, my mind like a killer&#x2019;s. It was easy to hide behind the dull face I wore, moping around. I really thought I had everybody fooled. And I didn&#x2019;t really read books about flowers or home economics. I liked books about awful things&#x2014;murder, illness, death. I remember selecting one of the thickest books from the public library, a chronicle of ancient Egyptian medicine, to study the gruesome practice of pulling the brains of the dead out through the nose like skeins of yarn. I liked to think of my brain like that, tangled up in my skull. The idea that my brains could be untangled, straightened out, and thus refashioned into a state of peace and sanity was a comforting fantasy. I often felt there was something wired weird in my brain, a problem so complicated only a lobotomy could solve it&#x2014;I&#x2019;d need a whole new mind or a whole new life. I could be very dramatic in my self-assessments. Besides books, I enjoyed my issues of <i>National Geographic</i> magazine, which I got delivered to me in the mail. That was a real luxury and made me feel very special. Articles describing the naive beliefs of the primitives fascinated me. Their blood rites, the human sacrifices, all that needless suffering. I was dark, you might say. Moony. But I don&#x2019;t think I was really so hardhearted by nature. Had I been born into a different family, I might have grown up to act and feel perfectly normal.</p><p>Truth be told, I was a glutton for punishment. I didn&#x2019;t really mind getting bossed around by my father. I&#x2019;d get angry, and I loathed him, yes, but my fury gave my life a kind of purpose, and running his errands killed time. That is what I imagined life to be&#x2014;one long sentence of waiting out the clock.</p><p>I tried to look miserable and exhausted when I came out from the bathroom that evening. My father groaned impatiently. I sighed and plucked the cash he held out. I buttoned my coat back up. I was relieved to have somewhere to go, a way to pass the evening hours other than to pace the attic or watch my father drink. There was nothing I loved more than leaving the house.</p><p>If I had slammed the front door hard on my way out, as I was tempted to, one of those icicles overhead would have surely cracked off. I imagined one plummeting through the hollow of my collarbone and stabbing me straight through the heart. Or, had I tilted my head back, perhaps it would have soared down my throat, scraping the vacuous center of my body&#x2014;I liked to picture these things&#x2014;and followed through to my guts, finally parting my nether regions like a glass dagger. That was how I imagined my anatomy back then, brain like tangled yarn, body like an empty vessel, private parts like some strange foreign country. But I was careful shutting the door, of course. I didn&#x2019;t really want to die.</p><p>Since my father had become unfit to drive it, I drove his old Dodge. I loved that car. It was a four-door Coronet, matte green, full of scrapes and dents. The floorboards had rusted through from years of salt and ice. I kept in the glove box of the Dodge a dead field mouse I&#x2019;d found one day on the porch frozen in a tight ball. I&#x2019;d picked it up by its tail and swirled it through the air for a moment, then slung it in the glove box with a broken flashlight, a map of New England freeways, a few green nickels. Every now and then that winter, I&#x2019;d peek at the mouse, check on its invisible decomposition in the freezing cold. I think it made me feel powerful somehow. A little totem. A good luck charm.</p><p>Outside I tested the temperature with the tip of my tongue, sticking it out into the biting wind until it hurt. That night it must have been down close to single digits. It hurt just to breathe. But I preferred cold weather over hot. Summers I was restless and cranky. I&#x2019;d break out in rashes, have to lie in cold baths. I&#x2019;d sit at my desk in the prison whipping a paper fan furiously at my face. I did not like to sweat in front of other people. Such proof of carnality I found lewd, disgusting. Similarly, I did not like to dance or do sports. I did not listen to the Beatles or watch Ed Sullivan on TV. I wasn&#x2019;t interested in fun or popularity back then. I preferred to read about ancient times, distant lands. Knowledge of anything current or faddish made me feel I was just a victim of isolation. If I avoided all that on purpose, I could believe I was in control.</p><p>One thing about that Dodge was that it made me sick to drive it. I knew there was something wrong with the exhaust, but at the time I couldn&#x2019;t think of dealing with such a problem. Part of me liked having to roll down the windows, even in the cold. I thought that I was very brave. But really I was scared that if I made a fuss over the car, it would be taken away from me. That car was the one thing in my life that ga...</p></p><h2>A Path Appears: Transforming Lives, Creating Opportunity</h2><p>An essential, galvanizing narrative about making a difference here and abroad&#x2014;a road map to becoming the most effective global citizens we can be.<br><br>In their number one <i>New York Times </i>best seller <i>Half the Sky, </i>husband-and-wife team Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn brought to light struggles faced by women and girls around the globe, and showcased individuals and institu�tions working to address oppression and expand opportunity. <i>A Path Appears </i>is even more ambi�tious in scale: nothing less than a sweeping tap�estry of people who are making the world a better place and a guide to the ways that we can do the same&#x2014;whether with a donation of $5 or $5 mil�lion, with our time, by capitalizing on our skills as individuals, or by using the resources of our businesses. <br><br> With scrupulous research and on-the-ground reporting, the authors assay the art and science of giving, identify successful local and global initia�tives, and share astonishing stories from the front lines of social progress. We see the compelling, in�spiring truth of how real people have changed the world, upending the idea that one person can&#x2019;t make a difference. <br><br> We meet people like Dr. Gary Slutkin, who devel�oped his landmark Cure Violence program to combat inner-city conflicts in the United States by applying principles of epidemiology; Lester Strong, who left a career as a high-powered television anchor to run an organization bringing in older Americans to tu�tor students in public schools across the country; MIT development economist Esther Duflo, whose pioneering studies of aid effectiveness have revealed new truths about, among other things, the power of hope; and Jessica Posner and Kennedy Odede, who are transforming Kenya&#x2019;s most notorious slum by ex�panding educational opportunities for girls. <br><br> <i>A Path Appears </i>offers practical, results-driven advice on how best each of us can give and reveals the lasting benefits we gain in return. Kristof and WuDunn know better than most how many urgent challenges communities around the world face to�day. Here they offer a timely beacon of hope for our collective future.</p><p>Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, husband and wife, have coauthored three previous books:&nbsp;<i>Half the Sky</i>,&nbsp;<i>Thunder from the East</i>, and&nbsp;<i>China Wakes</i>. They were awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1990 for their coverage of China and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize for Lifetime Achievement in 2009. Now an op-ed columnist for&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>, Kristof was previously bureau chief in Hong Kong, Beijing, and Tokyo. He won his second Pulitzer in 2006 for his columns on Darfur. WuDunn worked at <i>The&nbsp;New York Times</i>&nbsp;as a business editor and foreign correspondent in Tokyo and Beijing. She now works in banking.<br><br>@NickKristof; www.facebook.com/kristof<br> @WuDunn; www.facebook.com/SherylWuDunnDr. Gary Slutkin was back in Chicago, his hometown, feeling restless. He was a rumpled infectious diseases specialist who had spent most of his career in San Francisco and Africa, battling tuberculosis, AIDS, and cholera. But he had burned out in refugee camps, his marriage had fallen apart, and now it was time to be nearer to his elderly parents. He had no clue what to do for work.<br><br> As he explored options, Slutkin began hearing about gang violence in Chicago, about ten-year-olds shooting other kids; this was shocking, but it also sounded more like Somalia and other places he knew. Slutkin began to study inner-city violence and pored over graphs of homicides and shootings&#x2014;and to an epidemiologist they all seemed oddly familiar.<br><br> &#x201c;It hit me: this is an infectious disease,&#x201d; he said. The more Slutkin looked at urban violence, the more he felt that it had been misdiagnosed as solely a crime problem when in many ways it was a contagion analogous to cholera or leprosy. As with other contagions, an infection depends upon exposure among susceptible people who have low resistance or compromised immunity. Slutkin saw that &#x201c;an epidemic of violence&#x201d; is more than just a metaphor; in some ways murder actually spreads like a contagious disease.<br><br> &#x201c;It is just as tuberculosis begets tuberculosis, or flu begets flu,&#x201d; Slutkin says, &#x201c;that violence begets violence.&#x201d;<br><br>Once Slutkin had the insight that violence could be considered, in part, an infectious disease, he decided to tackle it as a public health problem and slow the epidemic. He started an organization called Cure Violence, and turned to ex-convicts and former gang members to act as health outreach workers and interrupt the contagion. When someone is shot, they go to the hospital room to counsel against a retaliatory hit. They gather intelligence on threats and negotiate peaceful solutions. More broadly, they try to change community norms so that those who use violence are scorned rather than respected. &#x201c;Violence is learned behavior,&#x201d; says Gary Slutkin. &#x201c;Violence can also be unlearned behavior.&#x201d;<br><br>In recent years, the Cure Violence model has spread to other cities in the United States and abroad&#x2014;even to Iraq and Colombia&#x2014;and results have been remarkable. Careful evaluations have found that Cure Violence can reduce serious violence by one-quarter or more, at a negligible cost. Gary Slutkin thinks that with some tweaking and enough resources, the model could reduce homicides by 70 percent.<br><br>Rachel Beckwith, Lester Strong, and Dr. Gary Slutkin reflect a yearning to express our humanity by finding innovative and effective ways to give back. We crave meaning and purpose in life, and one way to find it is to connect to a cause larger than ourselves. This book is about innovators who are using research, evidence- based strategies, and brilliant ideas of their own to prevent violence, improve health, boost education, and spread opportunity at home and around the world&#x2014;and to suggest to the rest of us specific ways in which we too can make a difference in the world. Some of these people we highlight raise or contribute the money, such as Rachel and her family and admirers who made something inspiring out of a tragedy. Some are organizers, such as Slutkin and Strong. Many more are foot soldiers. Together, they are all part of a revolution in tack- ling social problems, employing new savvy, discipline, and experience to chip away at poverty and injustice. On many issues ranging from failing schools in America to intestinal parasites in Africa, there are fascinating new approaches to making a difference; in some cases, the progress is startling.<br><br>So many social problems in the twenty-first century seem intractable and insoluble. We explore Mars and embed telephones in wrist- watches, but we can&#x2019;t keep families safe in the inner cities. We can map subatomic particles such as gluons, and we can design robots that drive cars, respond to speech, and defeat grandmasters in chess, but we grudgingly accept failure in our struggles to keep kids in school, off drugs, and out of gangs. Many of us know that it&#x2019;s wrong and unfair that boys growing up in certain zip codes are more likely to end up in prison than in college, but we throw up our hands and surrender to the exigencies of ghetto life. Violence and poverty, whether in Congo or Chicago, remain towering realities.<br><br>We started our married life together as foreign correspondents for <i>The New York Times, </i>and we have wondered for years how we can do a better job addressing the needs around us. Not everyone can help fight crime in a city&#x2019;s worst neighborhoods or volunteer in schools, so most of us are left to engage in piecemeal efforts such as a donation here or there. Like many Americans, we have day jobs we need to keep, and we have been busy raising our children; that has left us looking for great causes and people to support in modest ways. We aren&#x2019;t regular churchgoers who focus our giving on a particular religious establishment, and although we wanted to lend a hand, we never knew how to choose among the appeals from nonprofits that inundated us. Basically, we were mystified about how best to assist at home as well as abroad. So we investigated how one can do a better job of making a difference, how one can help institute effective change. This book is the fruit of our labors.</p><h2>Atkinson Grimshaw: Painter of Moonlight</h2><p>A study of the paintings of Leeds artist Atkinson Grimshaw (1836-93) whose images of wet streets, bare branches on winter afternoons, moon-lit nights and gaslit docksides are well known. The author assesses the artist&#39;s place in Victorian art and society and compares him with his contemporaries such as Tissot and Alma-Tadema. Some of Grimshaw&#39;s paintings which are normally in private collections are reproduced here for the first time.</p><p></p><h2>The Tower of Alchemy</h2><p>The Tower of Alchemy is the first book published in the West to openly reveal the teachings and practice of the Hermetic Art in plain language. In this advanced manual, the alchemical symbols and motifs cease to be a bewildering maze and become helpful signposts on the Path of Liberation. David Goddard clearly explains the interior practices that are the essence of the Great Work itself. By assimilating the knowledge and practicing the exercises contained in this book, you will find that the once-confusing alchemical illustrations are now illuminated mandalas. Using classical Qabalah, and traditions as diverse as the Grail legend, Yoga, and Tibetan Buddhism, Goddard allows students access to the higher Mysteries. His specific teachings and guided practices will enable you to attain the secret to all spiritual works, which can culminate in the completion of the Great Work.</p><p></p><h2>The Unknown Soldier</h2><p>Originally published in 1954 in Finnish.</p><p></p><h2>New Testament Theology: Many Witnesses, One Gospel</h2><p>A 2005 ECPA Gold Medallion winner! "New Testament theology is essentially missionary theology," writes I. Howard Marshall. Founded on a sure-footed mastery of the data and constructed with clear thinking lucidly expressed, this long-anticipated New Testament theology offers the insights born of a distinguished career of study, reflection, teaching and writing on the New Testament. Marshall's <em>New Testament Theology</em> will speak clearly to a broad audience of students and nonspecialists. But even on the most familiar ground, where informed readers might lower their expectations of learning something new, Marshall offers deft insights that sharpen understanding of the message of the New Testament. Here is a New Testament theology that does not succumb to the fashion of settling for an irreconcilable diversity of New Testament voices but argues that "a synthetic New Testament theology is a real possibility. Beginning with the Gospels and Acts, proceeding to each of Paul's letters, focusing then on the Johannine literature and finally looking at Hebrews and the remaining general epistles, Marshall repeatedly stops to assess the view. And gradually he builds up a composite synthesis of the unified theological voice of the New Testament. On the way toward this synthesis, Marshall highlights clearly the theological voices of the individual New Testament books. Thus, his New Testament theology serves also as a sort of introduction to the New Testament books, making it double as an attractive complement to book-by-book introductions to the New Testament. Here is a New Testament theology that will not only guide students and delight teachers but also reward expositors with a lavish fund of insights for preaching.</p><p>IVP: What can one hope to achieve in writing a New Testament theology? Is it something more than attempting to come up with a "good theological reading" of the New Testament? <p>I. Howard Marshall: I suppose that this question is really asking what New Testament theology is, and that is not an easy question to answer. What one can say is that all the New Testament authors are thinking and writing theologically whatever be the themes that they are addressing. What you are trying to do is to reconstruct the Christian beliefs that they must be presumed to have in order to write the things that they do. Similarly, you might try to reconstruct the political beliefs that shape the speeches of a politician, working back from what is explicit to what is implicit and gives content and coherence to the whole. </p><p>But then you have to go a bit further and ask whether the Christian beliefs of Paul, Luke, John and so on are essentially the same or diverse and even contradictory. A theology of the New Testament in the sense of a common body of belief held (with variations) by all the writers may be nothing more than a pious hope. Their views may have been so divergent that there is not enough of a common basis to warrant the name of "New Testament theology." I have tried to show that there is such a common core, while emphasizing that the different writers expressed and developed it in their own individual ways and at times not without problems (compare how Peter and Paul had a [in my opinion, temporary] difference of opinion, reflected in Galatians 2, and how James had to criticize what was probably a false understanding of Paul's theology). So a book on New Testament theology must exhibit the individual thinking of the various authors (and Jesus), show whether and how there is harmony between them, and bring out the particular nuances that may be peculiar to different writers.</p>I.

His expertise in rebuilding broken fronts earned him the nickname of the Fuhrer's Fireman,&#x201d; and throughout the war, Hitler relied on the rapidly promoted general to save his army in several desperate situations, despite the fact that Model was often quite blunt with his erratic Fuhrer.Model's greatest achievement was the restoration of stability along the eastern front in June 1944. In August he was sent to restore the deteriorating western front, where he re-established a strong defensive line along the West Wall in September. He was second-in-command at the Battle of the Bulge and was leading the German army when it collapsed at the end of the war. Rather than surrender, he shot himself in April 1945.Although Model destroyed most of his personal papers just before he died, Stephen H. Newton draws on a wide variety of original German sources, including extensive Wehrmacht archival material, to tell the first and only authoritative story of the commander who was Hitler's favorite.</p><p>Steven H. Newton is Professor of History at Delaware State University. His previous books on World War II include Kursk: The German View and Retreat from Leningrad.Unlike many of his contemporaries&#x2014;Rommel, Guderian, von Rundstedt&#x2014;who have been rescued from the anonymity of defeat, Model (1891&#x2013;1945) has "languished in relative obscurity." Historian Newton (<i>Panzer Operations</i>), a professor at Delaware State University, hopes to remedy that in this first English-language biography of the general dubbed the "F�hrer's Fireman" and "the Lion of the Defense." Newton follows Model's career from his heroic service as a young lieutenant on the Western Front in WWI through his meteoric rise to the command of an army group during WWII. Newton aims not only to rescue Model from obscurity but to rehabilitate his frayed reputation as a "Hitler sycophant" and war criminal. (It didn't help that Model's "abrasive personality" made him few friends or admirers.) Drawing on his extensive research in German and American archives, German war diaries and memoirs, Newton presents a picture of a "tactical genius" who was "pro-Hitler" but not blindly so. Facing certain defeat in April 1945, Model destroyed his papers and committed suicide, making the task of any future biographer difficult. In the absence of personal papers, Newton manages to reconstruct Model the commander but not Model the man. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You can&#x2019;t catch depression in the same way you catch a cold, but the latest research in neuroscience, social psychology, epidemiology, and genetics provides overwhelming support that moods spread through social conditions. Our social lives directly shape our brain chemistry and powerfully affect the way we think and feel; our brains change with positive life experiences and can change as much with social circumstances as with medication. Drugs may address some of depression&#x2019;s symptoms, but they cannot change the social factors that cause and perpetuate it. Indeed, Dr. Yapko argues convincingly, by treating a social condition as though it&#x2019;s a disease, the problems will spread rather than diminish. <br> <br>In <i>Depression Is Contagious</i>, Dr. Yapko identifies the patterns often seen in modern relationships that lead to depression and provides practical exercises that will help readers develop the skills and insights they need to forge stronger, healthier social connections. This practical, definitive book provides an empowering prescription for hope and healing through people, not pills.</p><p><b> <br>Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D.</b>, is a clinical psychologist and internationally recognized expert who lectures widely on depression, psychotherapy, and clinical hypnosis. He is the author of ten books, including <i>Breaking the Patterns of Depression</i>, <i>Hand-Me-Down Blues</i>, and <i>Suggestions of Abuse</i>. He lives with his wife, Diane, in Fallbrook, California.<b><b>Introduction</b></b> <p>The rate of depression is rising. According to the World Health Organization, the international watchdog of health issues around the world, depression is currently the <i>fourth</i> greatest cause of human suffering and disability around the world. That observation alone tells us how serious and pervasive the problem of depression already is. Even worse, however, is the World Health Organization prediction that by the year 2020, depression will have risen to become the <i>second</i> greatest cause of human suffering and disability. This unprecedented rapid growth rate is strong evidence that biology is less a factor in its spread and social forces the greater factor. </p><p>Is depression really on the rise, or are people just more tuned into depression as a general topic of interest? The best evidence we have suggests strongly that depression is increasing in prevalence not only in the United States but around the world. This is not simply because more people are seeking help for depression or because wary clinicians are diagnosing it more frequently. Rather, the increase appears to be the product of more and more people manifesting the signs and symptoms of depression. </p><p><b></b></p><b><b>People Can Spread Depression</b></b> <p>What we do to each other can too easily become the source of great hurt in our lives and can result in an enduring way of thinking, feeling, and relating to others. But, we are relearning something of vital importance that has been too often overlooked in recent years: Just as people can be a source of pain, they can also be a source of comfort and happiness and a way out of pain. In light of new research, being the strong, self-sufficient &#x201c;go it alone&#x201d; type no longer seems the most effective route to personal fulfillment. Instead, science is confirming what we have probably always known in our hearts: <i>We are built to be in positive, meaningful relationships with others in order to feel good</i>. Yet, today, our relationships are damaged and suffering in unprecedented ways. </p><p>As relationships face more challenges, whether in love, family, business, or friendship, depression is on the rise. Depression spreads in part through troubled relationships and, in this sense, is socially contagious. You can&#x2019;t catch depression in the same way you catch a cold, but the latest research in neuroscience, social psychology, epidemiology, and genetics provides overwhelming support that moods spread through social conditions. Our social lives directly shape our brain chemistry and powerfully affect the way we think and feel. With modern scanning technologies, we now have evidence that our brains change with positive life experiences. In fact, brains can change as much with social circumstances as with medication. Drugs may address some of depression&#x2019;s symptoms, but they cannot change the social factors that cause and perpetuate it. </p><p><b></b></p><b><b>The Skills for Living Well</b></b> <p>What makes for healthy, strong, happy people? Why do some people face stressful and challenging events in life and seem to rise above them, while other people implode in the face of what seem like routine stressors? These questions provide the foundation for much of what I will talk about in this book. The vast majority of research into depression has focused on the pathologies within people that presumably give rise to the disorder, such as character defects, anger-turned-inward, and chemical imbalances in the brain. Only recently has there emerged a different paradigm for thinking about human experience. Known as <i>positive psychology,</i> its focus is on what is <i>right</i> with people rather than on what is wrong. Instead of studying people who suffer, positive psychologists study people who have overcome adversity and thrived, who are happy, competent, and fulfilled. By striving to identify people&#x2019;s strengths, psychologists hope to help those who are suffering. </p><p>One of the first tasks positive psychologists attempted was to develop a new manual that would catalogue and define many of the best aspects of human experience. Unlike the well-known psychiatric manual listing various forms of psychopathology (the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,</i> now in its revised fourth edition, DSM-IV-R) used by mental health professionals to diagnose patients, a new manual called <i>Character Strengths</i><i>and Virtues</i> was developed by psychologists Chris Peterson and Martin Seligman to identify and describe some of the best human attributes. These include the courage to speak the truth, kindness, love, fairness, leadership, teamwork, forgiveness, modesty, gratitude, and many other such positive characteristics. If you reread that list of attributes, you cannot help but notice that they are wonderful human potentials that can <i>only</i> be expressed in the context of human relationships. Simply put, <i>how people develop their best selves is largely, though not entirely, achieved in the context of positive relationships with other people.</i> </p><p>At a time when we are learning how vitally important it is to have positive and healthy relationships, we are seeing such relationships on the general decline. Even a cursory review of recent U.S. Census data shows us the warning signs: More people are living alone than ever before, people wait longer to marry, on average, yet the national divorce rate remains slightly over 50 percent for first marriages, and even higher (about 70 percent) for second marriages. The number of births outside of marriage has risen sharply, and single parents who must work and are thereby too often unavailable to their kids experience and transmit stresses that are widely cited as a reason why children are often struggling emotionally. Millions of children are currently on antidepressant medication, as well as other psychoactive medications for their social and behavioral problems. </p><p>As families struggle and marriages wobble, large studies of the prevalence of various disorders in the general population show rates of depression nearly <i>four</i> times higher than a generation ago and nearly <i>ten</i> times as high as two generations ago. <i>Social skills have declined and relationships have become less rewarding and effective. As a result, the vulnerability to depression has increased.</i> </p><p>For over half a century, researchers have known that good relationships serve as a buffer against illnesses of all sorts. The evidence is clear, for example, that when you are happy in your primary relationships, you suffer less depression. Furthermore, people who enjoy close friendships and the support of others are happier and more productive. They also suffer fewer illnesses and, on average, live longer. We will explore the health and mood benefits of good relationships with others in the first chapter. What most of this book will be about, then, is how to develop the kinds of relationships that can help you overcome depression, and perhaps even <i>prevent</i> it. </p><p><b></b></p><b><b>Depression Rises as Relationships Fall</b></b> <p>Mental health experts have generally treated depression by giving their patients drugs and shock treatments and other newer brain stimulation treatments, or by talking with them about their childhoods. Yet the social conditions that give rise to depression continue unabated, allowing the rate of depression to continue to rise at an alarming rate. New research makes it clear that <i>depression is not just about the suffering of one individual, as if he or she lived in total isolation</i>. Rather, depression occurs in a social context; it occurs <i>within</i> people, and also arises from the hurts that take place in relationships <i>between</i> people. </p><p>The pains of rejection, humiliation, the loss of a loved one through a breakup or death, the betrayal of trust, the trauma of violence and abuse, and the many other ways people can wound each other are all reliable pathways into depression. Simply put, depression can be and often is a direct consequence of relationships that are, well, depressing. </p><p>Depression doesn&#x2019;t just affect individuals, although it&#x2019;s easy to focus on the person with the symptoms. For every depressed person who gets treatment, at least four more don&#x2019;t. For every depressed person who doesn&#x2019;t get treatment, his or her depression affects the lives of at least three others. For every depressed parent who goes without treatment, his or her child is at least three times more likely to become depressed than the child of a nondepressed parent. <i>Relationships can spread depression as surely as germs can spread illness</i>. Depression <i>is</i> contagious. </p><p>More and better drugs will <i>not</i> solve the problem. People who suffer depression, and the people who love them who suffer right alongside them, must also avoid overthinking the symbolic meaning of the depressive experience. Depressed people are usually already quite good at isolating themselves and thinking too deeply about themselves. Instead of examining them even more closely under the microscope, analyzing ever smaller pieces of their psyche, as if depression is just their individual problem, the solution lies in a broader view. We need a <i>macro</i>scope. <i>We need to see depression in its larger social context,</i> see it for what it is when the world gets more dangerously crowded while people are literally dying of loneliness. </p><p><b></b></p><b><b>Depression Gets a Lot of Attention ... but Not Nearly Enough</b></b> <p>Few mental health problems have received as much attention as the problem of depression. There are many reasons: (1) Depression has a huge <i>financial impact</i> on our society because of the exorbitant economic costs associated with it; these are measured in terms of lowered productivity, more employee sick days, and diminished job performance. Current estimates indicate depression is costing the U.S. economy at least $70 <i>billion</i> per year. (2) Depression&#x2019;s cost in terms of <i>health care expenses</i> is huge since it is so closely associated with cardiovascular disease,...</p></p><h2>The Prose of the World (Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy)</h2><p>The work that Maurice Merleau-Ponty planned to call <i>The Prose of the World,</i> or <i>Introduction to the Prose of the World,</i> was unfinished at the time of his death. The book was to constitute the first section of a two-part work whose aim was to offer, as an extension of his Phenomenology of Perception, a theory of truth. This edition's editor, Claude Lefort, has interpreted and transcribed the surviving typescript, reproducing Merleau-Ponty's own notes and adding documentation and commentary.<br></p><p>The work which this author planned to call The Prose of the World, or Introduction to the Prose of the World, is unfinished. There is good reason to believe that he deliberately abandoned it and that, he had lived, he would not have completed it, at least in the form that he first outlined. Once finished, the book was to constitute the first section of a two-part work--the second would have had a more distinct metaphysical nature--whose aim was to offer us, as an extension of the Phenomenology of Perception, a theory of truth.<p>Maurice Merleau-Ponty (14 March 1908 &#x2013; 3 May 1961) was a French phenomenological philosopher, strongly influenced by Karl Marx, Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger in addition to being closely associated with Jean-Paul Sartre (who later stated he had been "converted" to Marxism by Merleau-Ponty ) and Simone de Beauvoir. At the core of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy is a sustained argument for the foundational role that perception plays in understanding the world as well as engaging with the world. Like the other major phenomenologists, Merleau-Ponty expressed his philosophical insights in writings on art, literature, linguistics, and politics. He was the only major phenomenologist of the first half of the twentieth century to engage extensively with the sciences and especially with descriptive psychology.</p></p><h2>Song Of Solomon (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

For them, calculus is more than a branch of mathematics; it is a game they love playing together, a constant when all else is in flux. The teacher goes from the prime of his career to retirement, competes in whitewater kayaking at the international level, and loses a son. The student matures from high school math whiz to Ivy League professor, suffers the sudden death of a parent, and blunders into a marriage destined to fail. Yet through it all they take refuge in the haven of calculus--until a day comes when calculus is no longer enough.</p><br><p> Like calculus itself, <i>The Calculus of Friendship</i> is an exploration of change. It's about the transformation that takes place in a student's heart, as he and his teacher reverse roles, as they age, as they are buffeted by life itself. Written by a renowned teacher and communicator of mathematics, <i>The Calculus of Friendship</i> is warm, intimate, and deeply moving. The most inspiring ideas of calculus, differential equations, and chaos theory are explained through metaphors, images, and anecdotes in a way that all readers will find beautiful, and even poignant. Math enthusiasts, from high school students to professionals, will delight in the offbeat problems and lucid explanations in the letters.</p><br><p> For anyone whose life has been changed by a mentor, <i>The Calculus of Friendship</i> will be an unforgettable journey.</p></p><p><p>"As these two men find truer, deeper friendship through an exchange of letters on math, you may be surprised to find yourself, as I was, moved by powerful emotions. I never thought I'd get choked up by an equation--but these guys are plotting out the hardest kind of change to track: the movement from Me to Us."--<b>Alan Alda</b></p><p>"<i>The Calculus of Friendship</i> is an intriguing journey that casts mathematics in a most unusual light. Through thirty years of correspondence between student and teacher, we enter a private world where the rigors of logic are the last defense against the vagaries of life."--<b>Brian Greene, author of <i>The Elegant Universe</i></b></p><p>"In this delightfully inspired account of a thirty-year correspondence, two mathematicians discover even deeper things than theorems that are fundamental. A math book for the mind and for the heart."--<b>Larry Zimmerman, winner of the 1986 Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics Teaching</b></p><p>"Steven Strogatz has written an unpretentious, charming, original, and inspiring book. In a disarmingly personal depiction, Strogatz leads us through a story of friendship between understated mentor and virtuosic student. The mathematical excursions are as much a pleasure to read as the moving narrative of the unusual friendship that the mathematics inspires."--<b>Janna Levin, author of <i>A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines</i></b></p><p>"It is unusual for mathematicians to write in such personal terms and with such candor. Readers with any mathematical background will find this book intriguing and fascinating."--<b>John Adam, coauthor of <i>Guesstimation</i></b></p><p>"The gentle but unremittingly honest account of this friendship utterly absorbed me. Also, some of the calculus is hilarious."--<b>John Cleese</b></p><p>"Containing many mathematical morsels, this decades-long correspondence tells the story of a very special student-teacher relationship. These men have taught each other more than they could ever have envisioned."--<b>Adrian Banner, author of <i>The Calculus Lifesaver</i></b></p><p>"Mathematics speaks to the transcendental, as does this extraordinary friendship. A beautiful book!"--<b>James Tanton, founding director of the St. Mark's Institute of Mathematics</b></p><p>"This is a lovely book. Strogatz succeeds in producing a sincere tribute to teachers, and he emphasizes in a direct way the human element of mathematics."--<b>Barry Cipra, author of <i>Misteaks...and How to Find Them before the Teacher Does: A Calculus Supplement</i></b></p><b>Steven Strogatz</b> is the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Applied Mathematics at Cornell University.

Includes his own translation from the original Greek text.</p><p><p>&#x201c;What Michael has done with his music, he now does with his pen. What you&#x2019;ve loved in his writings&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll find on these pages. You&#x2019;ll hear the same passion and sense the same skill. And most of all&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll see the same Savior.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2013; Max Lucado</p><p>&#x201c;In <i>The Parable of Joy </i>you uniquely meet Christ at the level of intimacy He intends. You will never read John&#x2019;s gospel more richly.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2013; Larry Crabb<br><br>&#x201c;The gospel of John has a way of bringing out the best in us&#x2014;evoking reflection and prayer, obedience and belief from depths within us that we hardly knew were there. And it has done it yet again in Michael Card. His lived responsiveness to St. John is marked by winsomeness, lyricism, and joy, inviting us into this sacred text.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2013; Eugene Peterson<br><br>In his gospel, John the apostle gives eyewitness details that help us &#x201c;be there&#x201d; with Jesus. Now, Michael Card, with his unique blend of artistry and biblical&nbsp;knowledge,&nbsp;introduces you to the apostle and his gospel in a fresh new way&#x2014;including his own translation of the gospel from the original Greek text.<br><br>Michael&#x2019;s imagination, always grounded in solid biblical scholarship, makes John&#x2019;s stories of Jesus and the disciples come to life. Read them as you never have before, and you&#x2019;ll understand clearly, perhaps for the first time, why John&#x2019;s discipleship and close friendship with Jesus enable him to tell us details about Christ as no one else could.</p>Michael Card has recorded over 20 albums, authored or co-authored over 14 books, hosted two radio programs, and written for a wide range of magazines. While he has penned such favorite songs as &#34;&#34;El Shaddai&#34;&#34; and &#34;&#34;Emmanuel,&#34;&#34; sold over 4 million albums, written over nineteen #1 hits, and hosted television&#39;s Day of Discovery, the popularity of his work seems a stark contrast to his goal in lifeto simply, and quietly teach the Bible. &#34;&#34;The one thing we strive to achieve is to reach people where they are,&#34;&#34; explains Michael. &#34;&#34;Someone who is impacted by music may not be affected by reading a book, someone who loves reading might not care about talk radio, but by providing all of these things, whether it&#39;s my work or the work of someone else, there&#39;s a greater chance of reaching more people, who in turn will reach out to others in their own community.</p><h2>American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America</h2><p>Writing with all the brilliance, authority, and pungent wit that have distinguished his art criticism for Time magazine and his greatly acclaimed study of modern art, The Shock of the New, Robert Hughes now addresses his largest subject: the history of art in America. <br><br>The intense relationship between the American people and their surroundings has been the source of a rich artistic tradition. American Visions is a consistently revealing demonstration of the many ways in which artists have expressed this pervasive connection. In nine eloquent chapters, which span the whole range of events, movements, and personalities of more than three centuries, Robert Hughes shows us the myriad associations between the unique society that is America and the art it has produced:<br><br>"O My America, My New Founde Land"&nbsp;&nbsp;explores the churches, religious art, and artifacts of the Spanish invaders of the Southwest and the Puritans of New England; the austere esthetic of the Amish, the Quakers, and the Shakers; and the Anglophile culture of Virginia.<br><br>"The Republic of Virtue"&nbsp;&nbsp;sets forth the ideals of neo-classicism as interpreted in the paintings of Benjamin West, John Singleton Copley, and the Peale family, and in the public architecture of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Latrobe, and Charles Bulfinch.<br><br>"The Wilderness and the West"&nbsp;&nbsp;discusses the work of landscape painters such as Thomas Cole, Frederick Church, and the Luminists, who viewed the natural world as "the fingerprint of God's creation,"&nbsp;&nbsp;and of those who recorded America's westward expansion--George Caleb Bingham, Albert Bierstadt, and Frederic Remington--and the accompanying shift in the perception of the Indian, from noble savage to outright demon.<br><br>"American Renaissance" describes the opulent era that followed the Civil War, a cultural flowering expressed in the sculpture of Augustus Saint-Gaudens; the paintings of John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, and Childe Hassam; the Newport cottages of the super-rich; and the beaux-arts buildings of Stanford White and his partners.<br><br>"The Gritty Cities"&nbsp;&nbsp;looks at the post-Civil War years from another perspective: cast-iron cityscapes, the architecture of Louis Henri Sullivan, and the new realism of Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, the trompe-l'oeil painters, and the Ashcan School.<br><br>"Early Modernism" introduces the first American avant garde: the painters Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, Joseph Stella, Charles Demuth, Charles Sheeler, and Georgia O'Keeffe, and the premier architect of his time, Frank Lloyd Wright.<br><br>"Streamlines and Breadlines"&nbsp;&nbsp;surveys the boom years, when skyscrapers and Art Deco were all the rage . . . and the bust years that followed, when painters such as Edward Hopper, Stuart Davis, Thomas Hart Benton, Diego Rivera, and Jacob Lawrence showed Americans "the way we live now." <br><br>"The Empire of Signs"&nbsp;&nbsp;examines the American hegemony after World War II, when the Abstract Expressionists (Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, et al.) ruled the artistic roost, until they were dethroned by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, the Pop artists, and Andy Warhol, while individualists such as David Smith and Joseph Cornell marched to their own music.<br><br>"The Age of Anxiety"&nbsp;&nbsp;considers recent events: the return of figurative art and the appearance of minimal and conceptual art; the speculative mania of the 1980s, which led to scandalous auction practices and inflated reputations; and the trends and issues of art in the 90s.<br><br>Lavishly illustrated and packed with biographies, anecdotes, astute and stimulating critical commentary, and sharp social history, American Visions is published in association with a new eight-part PBS television series. Robert Hughes has called it "a love letter to America."&nbsp;&nbsp;This superb volume, which encompasses and enlarges upon the series, is an incomparably entertaining and insightful contemplation of its splendid subject.</p><p>Australian-born art critic Robert Hughes, author of the highly acclaimed study of modern art, <i>The Shock of the New</i> has made his home in the United States for the last 20 years. His latest undertaking, which he calls "a love letter to America," is his most massive: a 350-year history of art in America. Published in association with an eight-part PBS series of the same name, this is no scholarly text. With the same voracious wit and opinionated brilliance that have characterized his criticism for <i>Time</i> magazine, this tour-de-force spans three centuries of events, movements, and personalities that have shaped American society and its art. The reproductions are outstanding; 323 out of 365 are in rich, vivid color. Infinitely entertaining and perceptive, this superb book makes readers feel as if they have discovered a truer, hidden America. It seems certain to become one of the most important works in the art-historical canon.<b>Robert Hughes</b> was born in Australia in 1938. He has lived and worked in the United States since 1970. He has been art critic for <b>TIME</b> magazine for more than 25 years. His books include monographs on painters Lucien Freud and Frank Auerbach, a history of Australian art, <b>Heaven and Hell in Western Art</b> (1969), <b>The Shock of the New</b> (1981), <b>The Fatal Shore</b> (1987), a book of social criticism entitled <b>The Culture of Complaint</b> (1995), <b>Barcelona</b> (1992), and a collection of reviews, <b>Nothing If Not Critical</b> (1990).

Now, critics, sports writers and fans across America are cheering The NEW Thinking Man&#39;s Guide to Pro Football as the worthy heir to Zimmerman&#39;s 1971 classic The Thinking Man&#39;s Guide to Pro Football, which Howard Cosell called &#34;the best book of its kind I&#39;ve ever read.&#34; Far more than a revision, The NEW Thinking Man&#39;s Guide to Pro Football is virtually a brand-new book (in 1984) prompted by, as Zimmerman writes in his introduction, &#34;a whole new generation of players and coaches (who have) given rise to a new set of reflections about a world that is ever changing.&#34; Zimmerman examines positions, tactics, the great players and moments of peak performance, football scouting, broadcasting, minor leagues, the rule changes of the pst decade and how they have inspired new playing stategies (crisply illustrated with diagrams). And with characteristic verve, insight and no-nonsense prose, Zimmerman pays close attention to the effect of football&#39;&#39;s pounding nose-to-nose competition on the everyday player&#39;s personality.</p><p>Paul &nbsp;Zimmerman,&nbsp;known&nbsp;to readers of Sports Illustrated&nbsp;as&nbsp;"Dr&nbsp;Z,"&nbsp;went to Stanford and&nbsp;Columbia University, where he graduated from Columbia College and earned a Master's Degree&nbsp;from&nbsp;the School of Journalism. Paul's active football career included playing for&nbsp;Horace Mann High School, Stanford University,&nbsp;a&nbsp;United States Army&nbsp;team in Germany and the Westchester Crusaders in the&nbsp;Atlantic Coast Football League.&nbsp;While playing for Horace Mann, he played against St. Cecilia High School, then coached by a young Vince Lombardi. While at Columbia, Paul coached the lightweight football team. He&nbsp;also played rugby, first with a club team in Westchester County, N.Y., and&nbsp;then&nbsp;was one of the founders of&nbsp;The Old Blue Rugby Football&nbsp;Club. He&nbsp;also&nbsp;boxed with Ernest Hemingway at Brown's Gym in New York City. Paul started his career in journalism at the Sacramento Bee before heading back to New York with&nbsp;stints at&nbsp;the&nbsp;New York Journal-American,&nbsp;The&nbsp;New York World-Telegram and Sun&nbsp;and&nbsp;The New York Post. While at the Post, he covered five Olympics, including the 1972 Munich Games; there, 11 members of the Israeli&nbsp;team and delegation&nbsp;were murdered. He was short-listed&nbsp;for a Pulitzer&nbsp;Prize&nbsp;for his coverage of this event. Hired by Sports Illustrated in 1979, Paul was soon given the moniker&nbsp;"Dr.&nbsp;Z" for his vast knowledge of football. He worked as a senior writer for SI and SI.com until&nbsp;Nov. 22,&nbsp;2008 when he suffered a series of devastating strokes. Though he understands everything spoken to him, he can no longer read, write or speak. In 2013 Paul and NFL Films' Ken Rogers won an&nbsp;Emmy for the NFL Films short documentary, "Yours Truly,&nbsp;Dr. Z." Paul has two children, Sarah and Michael, and two stepchildren, Heather and Nathan.

In "Company" a solitary hearer lying in blackness calls up images from the far-off past. "Ill Seen Ill Said" meditates upon an old woman living out her last days alone in an isolated snow-bound cottage, watched over by twelve mysterious sentinels. In "Worstward Ho", a breathless speaker unravels the sense of things, acting out the unending injunction to 'Try again. Fail again. Fail better.' And "Stirrings Still", published in the "Guardian" a few months before Beckett's death in 1989, is the last prose work and testament of 'this great soothsayer of the age, and of the aged' (Christopher Ricks). The present edition includes several short prose texts ("Heard in the Dark" I &amp; II, "One Evening", "The Way", and, "Ceiling") which represent work in progress or works ancillary to the composition of these late masterpieces.</p><p>Samuel Beckett was born in Dublin in 1906 and graduated from Trinity College. He settled in Paris in 1937, after travels in Germany and periods of residence in London and Dublin. He remained in France during the Second World War and was active in the French Resistance. From the spring of 1946 his plays, novels, short fiction, poetry and criticism were largely written in French. With the production of <i>En attendant Godot</i> in Paris in 1953, Beckett's work began to achieve widespread recognition. During his subsequent career as a playwright and novelist in both French and English he redefined the possibilities of prose fiction and writing for the theatre. Samuel Beckett won the Prix Formentor in 1961 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969.

F. Schumacher's <i>Small Is Beautiful</i>, renowned economist Clair Brown argues persuasively for a new economics built upon equality, sustainability, and right living.</b></p><p>"<i>Buddhist Economics </i>will give guidance to all those who seek peace, fairness, and environmental sustainability." -Jeffrey Sachs, author of <i>The Age of Sustainable Development.</i></p><p>Traditional economics measures the ways in which we spend our income, but doesn't attribute worth to the crucial human interactions that give our lives meaning. </p><p> Clair Brown, an economics professor at U.C. Berkeley and a practicing Buddhist, has developed a holistic model, one based on the notion that quality of life should be measured by more than national income. Brown advocates an approach to organizing the economy that embraces rather than skirts questions of values, sustainability, and equity. Complementing the award-winning work of Jeffrey Sachs and Bill McKibben, and the paradigm-breaking spirit of Amartya Sen, Robert Reich, and Thomas Piketty, Brown incorporates the Buddhist emphasis on interdependence, shared prosperity, and happiness into her vision for a sustainable and compassionate world.</p><p> Buddhist economics leads us to think mindfully as we go about our daily activities, and offers a way to appreciate how our actions affect the well-being of those around us. By replacing the endless cycle of desire with more positive collective activities, we can make our lives more meaningful as well as happier. Inspired by the popular course Professor Brown teaches at U.C. Berkeley, <i>Buddhist Economics</i> represents an enlightened approach to our modern world infused with ancient wisdom, with benefits both personal and global, for generations to come.</p></p><p><b>Clair Brown </b>is a professor of economics and director of the Center for Work, Technology, and Society at the University of California, Berkeley. An economist focusing on work and economic justice, she is a past director of the Institute of International Relations at Berkeley, and chair of the Committee on Education Policy of the UCB Academic Senate. She lives in Richmond, CA.<p>"This book will both shake up one's worldview and help calm one's agitated soul. It's a reminder that 'economics' is infinitely more interesting than the reductionist kind we teach in universities, and that 'religion' has far more to offer our everyday lives than we sometimes imagine." - Bill McKibben, Author EAARTH and Founder 350.org</p><p>"An important and provocative book about where conventional economics goes wrong. As Clair Brown masterfully shows, a new and more sensible economics would focus on a sustainable environment, shared prosperity, and interdependence. Instead of being a dismal science, economics should be an inspiring story of how we can work together to improve the quality of life for all." - Robert B. Reich, Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley, and author of SAVING CAPITALISM</p><p>"<i>Buddhist Economics</i> will inspire people to seek a better and wiser use of society's know-how and resources. Brown declares her goal to 'expand the dialogue among people around the world who seek meaningful lives for all.' In this she succeeds splendidly." - Jeffrey D. Sachs, Special Advisor to the UN Secretary-General on the Millennium Development Goals, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University</p><p>"A long, long time ago Adam Smith demonstrated that the economy would work pretty well if everyone were selfish. But Clair Brown has done considerably better. Her perceptive, interesting, fun book,<i> Buddhist Economics</i>, demonstrates that we could be so much more well off in many different ways, if, instead, we were just nice. This book has important messages for everyone. I hope that it will be read by all economists, and also by everyone else." - George Akerlof, Nobel Laureate in Economics, 2001</p><p>"Revolutionary and urgently needed. This brilliant and beautifully argued book will not only change how you think about the most pressing problems that concern us all, it will inspire you to paths of action that lead to those problems' solutions. This is a game-changing read." - Dacher Keltner, author of THE POWER PARADOX</p></p><h2>The Woman Lit By Fireflies</h2><p>The author of Dalva and Legends of the Fall has created three stunning novellas that echo the best works of Raymond Carver and James Dickey. A superb collection that evokes life lived close to the land--and a brilliant portrayal of the complex relationships of the men and women there.</p><p><p><b>Jim Harrison </b>(1937-2016) was the author of over thirty-five books of poetry, nonfiction, and fiction, including <i>Legends of the Fall</i>, <i>The Road Home</i>, <i> The English Major</i>, and <i>The Farmer's Daughter</i>. His writing appeared in the<i> New Yorker</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, and the<i> New York Times</i>. He earned a National Endowment for the Arts grant, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Spirit of the West Award from the Mountains &amp; Plains Booksellers Association. His work has been recognized worldwide and published in twenty-two languages.</p>The three novellas in this production depict vastly different landscapes of the human heart. BROWN DOG, narrated by Ray Porter, follows a scavenging diver and his entangled loves. Porter is eminently believable as the tough, hard-drinking B.D., whose strong timbre is filled with intensity as his discovers the preserved body of an Indian chief in the depths of Lake Superior. Harrison&#39;s poetic side paints a vivid thriller in SUNSET LIMITED, narrated by Carrington MacDuffie, a story that reunites four 1960s radicals who are called upon to rescue an ex-cohort from a Mexican jail. MacDuffie strikes just the right unaffected yet expressive tones while narrating this compelling tale. In the last piece, Clare, the valiant WOMAN LIT BY FIREFLIES, flees her bigoted husband, ultimately hiding in an Iowa cornfield during a night of soul-searching. Lorna Raver&#39;s delivery resonates with Clare&#39;s gentle strength as she reflects upon her past.

The Complete History of the Universe and The Cosmic Tourist</p><h2>Nixon, Vol. 3: Ruin and Recovery, 1973-1990</h2><p>Watergate is a story of high drama and low skulduggery, of lies and bribes, of greed and lust for power. With access to the central characters, the public papers, and the trials transcripts, Ambrose explains how Nixon destroyed himself through a combination of arrogance and indecision, allowing a &#34;third-rate burglary&#34; to escalate into a scandal that overwhelmed his presidency. Within a decade and a half however, Nixon had become one of America&#39;s elder statesmen, respected internationally and at home even by those who had earlier clamoured loudest for his head. This is the story of Nixon&#39;s final fall from grace and astonishing recovery.</p><p>Foreign policy master, political brawler, family man, loner, tragic hero, criminal, elder statesman, eternal conniver--Richard Nixon plays all of these roles in the final installment of Ambrose's fascinating three-volume biography (1987, 1989) of the ex-President. Ambrose (History/Univ. of New Orleans) meticulously traces how Nixon--flush with triumph from his landslide reelection victory over George McGovern--spoiled, through his mishandling of Watergate, his best-laid plans for reorganizing the executive branch of the government and for achieving a durable peace in Vietnam and with the Soviet Union. There aren't many surprises here about this extensively documented portion of Nixon's life, but Ambrose compensates with an excellent assessment of his subject's character and record. The author underscores what America lost, as a result of Nixon's Icarus-like fall, in such areas as arms control, energy policy, the Mideast, and national health insurance (though, dubiously, he bemoans the Reagan Revolution without acknowledging how much it owed to Nixon's polarizing campaigns). Admiring Nixon's perseverance, Ambrose draws a sympathetic portrait of the beleaguered politician's attempts to handle a vain Henry Kissinger, military top brass contemptuous of d&#x201a;tente, even politicians and lawyers unnerved by Nixon's blatant disregard for the Constitution. In the end, despite appreciating Nixon's intelligence and ability, Ambrose scores the President for a lack of domestic achievements and an even more demonstrable lack of virtue. An adroit retelling of how Nixon plunged into his political black hole--and why, like Lady Macbeth's ``damned spot,'' and despite his carefully orchestrated comeback, his role in the Watergate cover-up can never be obliterated. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Although Ambrose discusses Nixon's post-presidential roles as author and elder statesman, this final volume of his three-part biography ( Nixon: The Education of a Politican, 1913-1962 , LJ 5/1/87; one of LJ 's "Best Books of 1987"; and Nixon: The Triumph of a Politician , LJ 11/1/89) is largely the story of Watergate. Unlike Tom Wicker's One of Us: Richard Nixon and the American Dream ( LJ 2/1/91), which credits Nixon as a domestic success, Ambrose concludes that because of Watergate, Nixon's well-intended national and international programs were not "accomplishments but might have beens." The ultimate and, to Ambrose, tragic legacy of the president who wanted to be admired but not liked was the destruction of the moderate wing of the Republican party. Complemented by Roger Morris's Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician and Herbert Parmet's Richard Nixon and His America (both reviewed LJ 12/89), Ambrose's three-volume biography is an indispensable acquisition for academic collections and is highly recommended for most public libraries as well.

In this book, Henri Nouwen combines creative case studies of ministry with stories from diverse cultures and religious traditions in preparing a new model for ministry. Weaving keen cultural analysis with his psychological and religious insights, Nouwen has come up with a balanced and creative theology of service that begins with the realization of fundamental woundedness in human nature. Emphasizing that which is in humanity common to both minister and believer, this woundedness can serve as a source of strength and healing when counseling others. Nouwen proceeds to develop his approach to ministry with an analysis of sufferings -- a suffering world, a suffering generation, a suffering person, and a suffering minister. It is his contention that ministers are called to recognize the sufferings of their time in their own hearts and make that recognition the starting point of their service. For Nouwen, ministers must be willing to go beyond their professional role and leave themselves open as fellow human beings with the same wounds and suffering -- in the image of Christ. In other words, we heal from our own wounds. Filled with examples from everyday experience, <i>The Wounded Healer</i> is a thoughtful and insightful guide that will be welcomed by anyone engaged in the service of others.</p><p>For more information on the life and works of Henri J.M.

She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.</p>When a girl is drowned after telling mystery writer Ariadne Oliver that she witnessed a murder, Hercule Poirot finds himself looking into several unresolved deaths in an English town. John Moffatt exaggerates Poirot's Belgian accent, but his speech is always clear, with the inflections used to good effect in making observations about human nature and showing the way Poirot uses flattery and manipulation to gain the confidence of witnesses. It's the observations about people that make this Agatha Christie novel work as the author brings her cozy mystery style into the less-than-cozy 1960s, giving Poirot and Oliver the chance to react to changing times.

In 1969, in Las Vegas, Bova and a friend were hand-picked from a line of waiting show-goers to meet Elvis backstage. Bova believes that her instant rapport with the King grew out of the fact that she is a twin, as Elvis was, although his brother died at birth. Thus began her three-year relationship with a man who was obviously troubled and affected by giant mood swings. Though her own personality remains in the background, Bova manages a no-nonsense outlook and explains that she stood by her man because of love, even though he was married and had complete disregard for her career. Presley had some odd ideas about women: He was so insistent on purity that she hesitated to inform him that she was not a virgin (``In a way he was right, it would be `new' for me,'' she thought about her prospective sexual experience with him), and when Bova was pregnant (unbeknownst to him), he explained that once a woman had given birth he could no longer be attracted to her (she subsequently had an abortion). Presley's addiction to sleeping pills was a constant problem, but Bova had trouble confronting him about it and took them herself at his insistence. Bova also outlines the King's spiritual side, which involved vague, self- important beliefs that he was teaching people through music and that he was ``put here on earth to serve a special purpose'' with his unique powers. A somewhat pathetic portrait of the entertainer limping toward death. (16-page photo insert, not seen) (First serial to National Star; Literary Guild alternate selection) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Here's a novel idea: a book about someone who knew Elvis Presley. At least Bova knew him in the biblical sense, which adds a little spice to what otherwise is as slight and silly as a Presley movie. Act one: Joyce Bova, 24-year-old Priscilla Presley lookalike who works on Capitol Hill, goes to Las Vegas where a backstage meeting with the King sets hearts fluttering. Act two: well, the flap copy says it best: "In a whirlwind romance that swept her from the corridors of Congress to the secluded verandas of Graceland, Joyce jeopardized her career and defied her strict Catholic upbringing to be with her lover." Act three: Bova gets pregnant, but when she tries to tell Elvis the news, he gives her his take on motherhood: mamas don't have sex after the baby is born. (Readers of Priscilla Presley's book will recall that the King suffered from an industrial-strength dose of the whore/madonna complex.) Act three, continued: Bova has an abortion, but that doesn't save a relationship riddled with too many drugs. As with so many who knew Elvis, Bova apparently has total recall of every conversation she ever had with the man. There's not much to remember, really, but it beats Bova's own musings on life: "I sat there by myself in the dark and thought and dreamed and fought that lonely battle we fight against our own insecurity, against the icy inner terror that freezes your guts and makes you shrink back from the big scary world out there." It may freeze your own guts to buy this book, but if there are Presley fans in your neighborhood--and there are--you have no choice. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Union Station Kansas City</h2><p>In this detailed and comprehensive account, Jeffrey Spivak of The Kansas City Star tells the story of Union Station from its birth after the turn of the century, through the decades when it was both a transportation and social hub of Kansas City, and through its decline and threatened demolition.

In <i>Room Temperature,</i> his self-deprecating, endlessly curious narrator is at home giving his baby girl a bottle and allowing his mind to wander. Uppermost in his thoughts are his wife and daughter, but there is also that obsession with commas and some concern with tiny taboos like nose-picking and stealing change from his parents. Truth-telling is the operative mode; at one point he tries to get his wife to explain a doodle by quoting a review of early Yeats: "Always true is always new." <i>Room Temperature</i> is a rare novel of domestic pleasure and stability, with a twist. "Was there ever a limit between us? Would disgust ever outweigh love?" Baker's alter ego asks, and seems determined to find out.In his second novel, Baker turns a young father&#39;s feeding-time reverie into a catalog of the minutiae of domestic love.</p><h2>Fountain Pen</h2><p>Alexander Crum Ewing heads the Collectors Department at Bonhams Auctioneers in London, the world&#39;s largest auctioneer of fine and rare vintage fountain pens.

Simultaneous.</p><p>Abigail twisted a corner of her shawl and lifted it to wipe the tears running down her cheeks. Fear nearly compressed her chest, and she wondered when--if--she would ever see Alban and Leah again.<br> She felt eyes observing her and realized that the soldier, Linux, was not watching his friend depart. He was looking at her. <br>A chill ran through Abigail. She had noticed the handsome Roman officer before, as well as his boldness. She tightened the shawl about her face, covering all but her eyes, and turned away to watch the fast-fleeing mount and its two riders disappear around the corner.<br>As the sound of their racing gallop over the cobblestones faded away, Abigail moved her head to see the entire community of believers standing in stunned silence. No longer the wedding music. No longer the laughter and camaraderie, the dancing and feasting. Once more their world had abruptly changed with this vivid reminder of who they were, where they were. Aliens in their own land. Judeans, certainly, yet viewed as enemies by their own religious leaders as well as the Roman conquerors.<br>Out of the silence came a confident voice. Though little more than a whisper, it resonated through the stillness of the courtyard, a prayer that came from the heart and soul of the former fisherman of Galilee. "Go with God," breathed Peter, his arm outstretched toward the alley through which the couple had fled.<br>"Go with God," echoed throughout the group, as though the entire gathering took a fresh breath. Yes. God was with the two now escaping for their lives, as he was with those left to face the hunters.In first-century Judea, the followers of the Way have burgeoned into a vibrant, growing community that cannot be ignored. Jerusalem is in turmoil as its religious leaders on one side, and their Roman rulers on the other, conspire to stamp out the fledgling Church. And Abigail, who thought she had finally found home and safety, is caught between the opposing forces.<br><br>Two suitors desire the lovely Abigail's hand in marriage. One, a successful Hebrew merchant and widower with important connections among the Sanhedrin, is looking for a mother for his children. The Roman soldier Linux is fascinated by her winsome charm and possibly could offer the sanctuary--maybe even the love--for which she yearns. But her heart has been captured by neither of these. Will her faith and courage survive a heartbreak beyond comprehension as the followers face a gathering storm of persecution they never could have foreseen?<br><br>A glimmer of hope beckons Abigail forward....</p><h2>Vicars of Christ: the Dark Side of the Papacy</h2><p>Argues that the holy fathers, from St. Peter to Pope John Paul II, have included document forgers, men with numerous mistresses and illegitimate children, those who murdered thousands of Christians, and who caused tremendous suffering</p><p>De Rosa ( Prayers for Pagans and Hypocrites ) is an angry Catholic. In the worst proselytizing tradition, this devil's advocate overstates familiar arguments, bludgeoning the reader with his dossier against the Church. Among De Rosa's tamer charges: Jesus renounced possessions, but his vicars celebrate high mass garbed in cloth of gold; the Church has never lifted strictures against usury, yet the Vatican operates a bank. De Rosa sweeps through Church history to parade popes who begat children, popes who fornicated on a grand scale, popes who married. Then in the second half of this polemic, he addresses Church teaching, conjoining the "immaculate conception" doctrine to decrees governing birth control, abortion, celibacy. The doctrine of papal infallibility is dealt with, as is Church anti-Semitism through the ages leading to the Holocaust silence of Pius XII, the "one man in the world whose witness Hitler feared." And in wrapping up his catalog of "the sins of the papacy," De Rosa virtually dismisses internal reform: "It is not Catholics but other Christians who chiefly can make the papacy what it ought to be." <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.In his history of the papacy, former Jesuit De Rosa aims to undermine belief in papal infallibility. Although he claims to be a friend of the Catholic Church, and does at times express admiration for the holiness of many of the Popes, his book is so heavily weighted with information on the corruption of the Papacy that it would be hard for any reader to see any good in the office. The book cannot be faulted historically or stylistically, though most of the informationincluding the most sordidcan be found in the standard Roman Catholic sources. Patrick Grainfeld's The Limits of the Papacy (Crossroad, 1987) offers a more balanced view of the expansion of papal power. Augustine J.

In the end, you can boil everything down to something similar&#x2014;or so Roberta Anderson thought much later on. It&#x2019;s either all an accident&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or all fate. Anderson literally stumbled over her destiny in the small town of Haven, Maine, on June 21, 1988. That stumble was the root of the matter; all the rest was nothing but history.<br> 2<p></p> <br>Anderson was out that afternoon with Peter, an aging beagle who was now blind in one eye. Peter had been given to her by Jim Gardener in 1976. Anderson had left college the year before with her degree only two months away to move onto her uncle&#x2019;s place in Haven. She hadn&#x2019;t realized how lonely she&#x2019;d been until Gard brought the dog. He&#x2019;d been a pup then, and Anderson sometimes found it difficult to believe he was now old&#x2014;eighty-four in dog&#x2019;s years. It was a way of measuring her own age. Nineteen-seventy-six had receded. Yes indeed. When you were twenty-five, you could still indulge in the luxury of believing that, in your case, at least, growing up was a clerical error which would eventually be rectified. When you woke up one day and discovered your dog was eighty-four and you yourself were thirty-seven, that was a view that had to be reexamined. Yes indeed.<br> <br>Anderson was looking for a place to cut some wood. She&#x2019;d a cord and a half laid by, but wanted at least another three to take her through the winter. She had cut a lot since those early days when Peter had been a pup sharpening his teeth on an old slipper (and wetting all too often on the dining-room rug), but the place was still not short. The property (still, after thirteen years, mostly referred to by the townspeople as the old Garrick place) had only a hundred and eighty feet on Route 9, but the rock walls marking the north and south boundaries marched off at diverging angles. Another rock wall&#x2014;this one so old it had degenerated into isolated rock middens furred with moss&#x2014;marked the property&#x2019;s rear boundary about three miles into an unruly forest of first-and second-growth trees. The total acreage of this pie-shaped wedge was huge. Beyond the wall at the western edge of Bobbi Anderson&#x2019;s land were miles of wilderness owned by the New England Paper Company. Burning Woods, on the map.<br> <br>In truth, Anderson didn&#x2019;t really need to hunt a place to do her cutting. The land her mother&#x2019;s brother had left her was valuable because most of the trees on it were good hardwood relatively untouched by the gypsy-moth infestation. But this day was lovely and warm after a rainy spring, the garden was in the ground (where most of it would rot, thanks to the rains), and it wasn&#x2019;t yet time to start the new book. So she had covered the typewriter and here she was with faithful old one-eyed Peter, rambling.<br> <br>There was an old logging road behind the farm, and she followed this almost a mile before striking off to the left. She was wearing a pack (a sandwich and a book in it for her, dog biscuits for Peter, and lots of orange ribbon to tie around the trunks of the trees she would want to cut as September&#x2019;s heat ebbed toward October) and a canteen. She had a Silva compass in her pocket. She had gotten lost on the property only once, and once was enough to last her forever. She had spent a terrible night in the woods, simultaneously unable to believe she had actually gotten lost on property she for Christ&#x2019;s sweet sake owned and sure she would die out here&#x2014;a possibility in those days, because only Jim would know she was missing, and Jim only came when you weren&#x2019;t expecting him. In the morning, Peter had led her to a stream, and the stream had led her back to Route 9, where it burbled cheerfully through a culvert under the tar only two miles from home. Nowadays she probably had enough woods savvy to find her way back to the road or to one of the rock walls bounding her land, but the key word was probably. So she carried a compass.<br> <br>She found a good stand of maple around three o&#x2019;clock. In fact, she had found several other good stands of wood, but this one was close to a path she knew, a path wide enough to accommodate the Tomcat. Come September 20th or so&#x2014;if someone didn&#x2019;t blow the world up in the meantime&#x2014;she would hook her sledge up to the Tomcat, drive in here, and do some cutting. Besides, she had walked enough for one day.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look good, Pete?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pete barked feebly, and Anderson looked at the beagle with a sadness so deep it surprised and disquieted her. Peter was done up. He seldom took after birds and squirrels and chipmunks and the occasional woodchuck these days; the thought of Peter running a deer was laughable. She would have to take a good many rest stops on the way back for him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there had been a time, not that long ago (or so her mind stubbornly maintained), when Peter would always have been a quarter of a mile ahead of her, belling volleys of barks back through the woods. She thought there might come a day when she would decide enough was enough; she&#x2019;d pat the seat on the passenger side of the Chevrolet pickup for the last time, and take Peter to the vet down in Augusta. But not this summer, please God. Or this fall or winter, please God. Or ever, please God.<br> <br>Because without Peter, she would be alone. Except for Jim, and Jim Gardener had gotten more than just a trifle wiggy over the last eight years or so. Still a friend, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wiggy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Glad you approve, Pete old man,&#x201d; she said, putting a ribbon or two around the trees, knowing perfectly well she might decide to cut another stand and the ribbons would rot here. &#x201c;Your taste is only exceeded by your good looks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter, knowing what was expected of him (he was old, but not stupid), wagged his scraggy stub of a tail and barked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Be a Viet Cong!&#x201d; Anderson ordered.<br> <br>Peter obediently fell on his side&#x2014;a little wheeze escaped him&#x2014;and rolled on his back, legs splayed out. That almost always amused Anderson, but today the sight of her dog playing Viet Cong (Peter would also play dead at the words &#x201c;hooch&#x201d; or &#x201c;My Lai&#x201d;) was too close to what she had been thinking about.<br> <br>&#x201c;Up, Pete.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pete got up slowly, panting below his muzzle. His white muzzle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go back.&#x201d; She tossed him a dog biscuit. Peter snapped at it and missed. He snuffed for it, missed it, then came back to it. He ate it slowly, without much relish. &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Anderson said. &#x201c;Move out.&#x201d;<br> 3<p></p> <br>For want of a shoe, the kingdom was lost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the choice of a path, the ship was found.<br> <br>Anderson had been down here before in the thirteen years that the Garrick place hadn&#x2019;t become the Anderson place; she recognized the slope of land, a deadfall left by pulpers who had probably all died before the Korean War, a great pine with a split top. She had walked this land before and would have no trouble finding her way back to the path she would use with the Tomcat. She might have passed the spot where she stumbled once or twice or half a dozen times before, perhaps by yards, or feet, or bare inches.<br> <br>This time she followed Peter as the dog moved slightly to the left, and with the path in sight, one of her elderly hiking boots fetched up against something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fetched up hard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; she yelled, but it was too late, in spite of her pinwheeling arms. She fell to the ground. The branch of a low bush scratched her cheek hard enough to bring blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; she cried, and a bluejay scolded her.<br> <br>Peter returned, first sniffing and then licking her nose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Christ, don&#x2019;t do that, your breath stinks!&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter wagged his tail. Anderson sat up. She rubbed her left cheek and saw blood on her palm and fingers. She grunted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice going,&#x201d; she said, and looked to see what she had tripped over&#x2014;a fallen piece of tree, most likely, or a rock poking out of the ground. Lots of rock in Maine.<br> <br>What she saw was a gleam of metal.<br> <br>She touched it, running her finger along it and then blowing off black forest dirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; she asked Peter.<br> <br>Peter approached, sniffed at it, and then did a peculiar thing. The beagle backed off two dog-paces, sat down, and uttered a single low howl.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who got on your case?&#x201d; Anderson asked, but Peter only sat there. Anderson hooked herself closer, still sitting down, sliding on the seat of her jeans. She examined the metal in the ground.<br> <br>Roughly three inches stuck out of the mulchy earth&#x2014;just enough to trip over. There was a slight rise here, and perhaps the runoff from the heavy spring rains had freed it. Anderson&#x2019;s first thought was that the skidders who had logged this land in the twenties and thirties must have buried a bunch of their leavings here&#x2014;the cast-off swill of a three-day cutting, which in those days had been called a &#x201c;loggers&#x2019; weekend.&#x201d;<br> <br>A tin can, she thought&#x2014;B&amp;M beans or Campbell&#x2019;s soup. She wiggled it the way you&#x2019;d wiggle a tin can out of the earth. Then it occurred to her that no one except a toddler would be apt to trip over the leading edge of a can. The metal in the earth didn&#x2019;t wiggle. It was as solid as mother-rock. A piece of old logging equipment, maybe?<br> <br>Intrigued, Anderson examined it more closely, not seeing that Peter had gotten to his feet, backed away another four paces, and sat down again.<br> <br>The metal was a dull gray&#x2014;not the bright color of tin or iron at all. And it was thicker than a can, maybe a quarter-inch at its top. Anderson placed the pad of her right index finger on this edge and felt a momentary odd tingling, like a vibration.<br> <br>She took her finger away and looked at it quizzically.<br> <br>Put it back.<br> <br>Nothing. No buzz.<br> <br>Now she pinched it between her thumb and finger and tried to draw it from the earth like a loose tooth from a gum. It didn&#x2019;t come. She was gripping the protrusion in the rough center. It sank back into the earth&#x2014;or that was the impression she had then&#x2014;on either side at a width of less than two inches. She would later tell Jim Gardener that she could have walked past it three times a day for forty years and never stumbled over it.<br> <br>She brushed away loose soil, exposing a little more of it. She dug a channel along it about two inches deep with her fingers&#x2014;the soil gave easily enough, as forest soil does&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at least until you hit the webwork of roots. It continued smoothly down into the ground. Anderson got up on her knees and dug down along either side. She tried wiggling it again. Still no go.<br> <br>She scraped away more soil with her fingers and quickly exposed more&#x2014;now she saw six inches of gray metal, now nine, now a foot.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a car or a truck or a skidder, she thought suddenly. Buried out here in the middle of nowhere. Or maybe a Hooverville kind of stove. But why here?<br> <br>No reason that she could think of; no reason at all. She found things in the woods from time to time&#x2014;shell casings, beer cans (the oldest not with pop-tops but with triangleshaped holes made by what they had called a &#x201c;churchkey&#x201d; back in those dim dead days of the 1960s), candy wrappers, other stuff. Haven was not on either of Maine&#x2019;s two major tourist tracks, one of which runs through the lake and mountain region to the extreme west of the state and the other of which runs up the coast to the extreme east, but it had not been the forest primeval for a long, long time. Once (she had been over the decayed stone wall at the back of her land and actually trespassing on New England Paper Company&#x2019;s land at the time) she had found the rusted hulk of a late-forties Hudson Hornet standing in what had once been a woods road and what was now, over twenty years after the cutting had stopped, a tangle of second growth&#x2014;what the locals called shit-wood. No reason that hulk of a car should have been there, either&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it was easier to explain than a stove or a refrigerator or any other damn thing actually buried in the ground.<br> <br>She had dug twin trenches a foot long on either side of the object without finding its end. She got down almost a foot before scraping her fingers on rock. She might have been able to pull the rock out&#x2014;that at least had some wiggle&#x2014;but there was no reason to do it. The object in the earth continued down past it.<br> <br>Peter whined.<br> <br>Anderson glanced at the dog, then stood up. Both knees popped. Her left foot tingled with pins and needles. She fished her pocket watch out of her pants&#x2014;old and tarnished, the Simon watch was another part of her legacy from Uncle Frank&#x2014;and was astonished to see that she had been here a long time: an hour and a quarter at least. It was past four.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Pete,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s bug out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter whined again but still wouldn&#x2019;t move. And now, with real concern, Anderson saw that her old beagle was shivering all over, as if with ague. She had no idea if dogs could catch ague, but thought old ones might. She did recollect that the only time she had ever seen Peter shiver like that was in the fall of 1977 (or maybe it had been &#x2019;78). There had been a catamount on the place. Over a series of perhaps nine nights it had screamed and squalled, very likely in unrequited heat. Each night Peter would go to the living-room window and jump up on the old church pew Anderson kept there by her bookcase. He never barked. He only looked out into the dark toward that unearthly, womanish squealing, nostrils flaring, ears up. And he shivered.<br> <br>Anderson stepped over her little excavation and went to Peter. She knelt down and ran her hands along the sides of Peter&#x2019;s face, feeling the shiver in her palms.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, boy?&#x201d; she murmured, but she knew what was wrong. Peter&#x2019;s good eye shifted past her, toward the thing in the earth, and then back to Anderson. The plea in the eye not veiled by the hateful, milky cataract was as clear as speech: Let&#x2019;s get out of here, Bobbi, I like that thing almost as much as I like your sister.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Anderson said uneasily. It suddenly occurred to her that she could not remember ever having lost track of time as she had today, out here.<br> <br>Peter doesn&#x2019;t like it. I don&#x2019;t either.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on.&#x201d; She started up the slope to the path. Peter followed with alacrity.<br> <br>They were almost to the path when Anderson, like Lot&#x2019;s wife, looked back. If not for that last glance, she might actually have let the whole thing go. Since leaving college before finals&#x2014;in spite of her mother&#x2019;s tearful pleas and her sister&#x2019;s furious diatribes and baleful ultimatums&#x2014;Anderson had gotten good at letting things go.<br> <br>The look back from this middle distance showed her two things. First, the thing did not sink back into the earth as she had at first thought. The tongue of metal was sticking up in the middle of a fairly fresh declivity, not wide but fairly deep, and surely the result of late-winter runoff and the heavy spring rains that had followed it. So the ground to either side of the protruding metal was higher, and the metal simply disappeared back into it. Her first impression, that the thing in the ground was the corner of something, wasn&#x2019;t true after all&#x2014;or not necessarily true. Second, it looked like a plate&#x2014;not a plate you&#x2019;d eat from, but a dull metal plate...</p><h2>James, Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls</h2><p>Drawing on the Dead Sea Scrolls and on long overlooked early Church texts, Eisenman reveals in this groundbreaking major exploration the Christianity of Paul as a distortion of what James and Jesus preached. Whereas James and his followers, "zealous for the Law" of Moses, were nationalistic and apocalyptic, Paul's Hellenized movement promoted itself as pacifist, cosmopolitan, and faith-based.<br>In an argument with enormous implications, Eisenman identifies Paul as deeply compromised by Roman contacts, and James as not simply the leader of Christianity of his day, but the popular Jewish leader of his time, whose death triggered the Uprising against Rome. Creative rewriting of early Church documents has obscured this fact.<br>Eisenman shows that characters like "Judas Iscariot" and "the Apostle James" did not exist as such and details an actual physical assault by Paul on James in the Temple. By rescuing James from the oblivion into which he was deliberately cast, James the Brother of Jesus reveals one of the most successful historical rewrite enterprises ever accomplished.</p><p>Robert Eisenman, one of the most eminent researchers of early Christianity working today, has produced an exhaustive study of the historical milieu at the time of Jesus and come to the conclusion that James, rather than Peter, was heir to his teachings. Because the historical material regarding James is actually quite plentiful, a clear picture arises not only in regard to who James was, but by extension, who Jesus was also. Controversy is assured; still, given a patient reading, one will discover that Eisenman&#39;s research is meticulous, his arguments cogent, and his conclusions persuasive. This should prove to be a popular and influential book.<b>Robert Eisenman</b> is Professor of Middle East Religions and Archaeology and Director of the Institute for the Study of Judeo-Christian Origins at California State University, Long Beach; and Visiting Senior Member of Linacre College, Oxford University.

But the 1980's brought a revolutionary change. With the advent of improved computer power, scientists could apply complexity theory--nonlinear thinking--to scientific processes far more easily than ever before. Physicist Fritjof Capra was at the forefront of the revolution, and in <i>The Web of Life </i>he extended its scope by showing the impact of complexity theory on living organisms. In <i>The Hidden Connections</i> he breaks through another frontier, this time applying the principles of complexity theory to an analysis of the broad sphere of all human interactions.<br><br>Capra posits that in order to sustain life in the future, the principles underlying our social institutions must be consistent with the organization that nature has evolved to sustain the "web of life." In a lucid and convincing argument, Capra explains how the theoretical ideas of science can be applied to the practical concerns of our time. Covering every aspect of human nature and society, he discusses such vital matters as the management of human organizations, the challenges and dangers of economic globalization, and the nature and the problems of biotechnology. He concludes with an authoritative, often provocative plan for designing ecologically sustainable communities and technologies as alternatives to the current economic globalization.<br><br>A brilliant, incisive examination of the relationship between science and our social systems, <i>The Hidden Connections </i>will spark enormous debate in the scientific community and inspire us to think about the future of humanity in a new way.</p><p><b>FRITJOF CAPRA, </b>a world-renowned physicist, is the author of <i>The Tao of Physics, The Turning Point, Uncommon Wisdom, The Web of Life, </i>and coauthor of <i>Belonging to the Universe</i>, winner of an American Book Award in 1992. He is the director of the Center for Ecoliteracy in Berkeley, California, where he lives.One<br><br>THE NATURE OF LIFE<br><br>Before introducing the new unified framework for the understanding of biological and social phenomena, I would like to revisit the age-old question "What is life?" and look at it with fresh eyes. I should emphasize right from the start that I will not address this question in its full human depth, but will approach it from a strictly scientific perspective; and even then, my focus will at first be narrowed down to life as a biological phenomenon. Within this restricted framework, the question may be rephrased as: "What are the defining characteristics of living systems?"<br><br>Social scientists might prefer to proceed in the opposite order--first identifying the defining characteristics of social reality, and then extending into the biological domain and integrating it with corresponding concepts in the natural sciences. This would no doubt be possible, but having been trained in the natural sciences and having previously developed a synthesis of the new conception of life in these disciplines, it is natural for me to begin there.<br><br>I could also argue that, after all, social reality evolved out of the biological world between two and four million years ago, when a species of "Southern apes" (Australopithecus afarensis) stood up and began to walk on two legs. At that time, the early hominids developed complex brains, toolmaking skills and language, while the helplessness of their prematurely born infants led to the formation of the supportive families and communities that became the foundation of human social life. Hence, it makes sense to ground the understanding of social phenomena in a unified conception of the evolution of life and consciousness.<br><br>Focus on Cells<br><br>When we look at the enormous variety of living organisms--animals, plants, people, microorganisms--we immediately make an important discovery: all biological life consists of cells. Without cells, there is no life on this Earth. This may not always have been so--and I shall come back to this question--but today we can say confidently that all life involves cells.<br><br>This discovery allows us to adopt a strategy that is typical of the scientific method. To identify the defining characteristics of life, we look for and then study the simplest system that displays these characteristics. This reductionist strategy has proved very effective in science--provided that one does not fall into the trap of thinking that complex entities are nothing but the sum of their simpler parts.<br><br>Since we know that all living organisms are either single cells or multicellular, we know that the simplest living system is the cell. More precisely, it is a bacterial cell. We know today that all higher forms of life have evolved from bacterial cells. The simplest of these belong to a family of tiny spherical bacteria known as mycoplasm, with diameters less than a thousandth of a millimeter and genomes consisting of a single closed loop of double-stranded DNA. Yet even in these minimal cells, a complex network of metabolic processes is ceaselessly at work, transporting nutrients in and waste out of the cell, and continually using food molecules to build proteins and other cell components.<br><br>Although mycoplasm are minimal cells in terms of their internal simplicity, they can only survive in a precise and rather complex chemical environment. As biologist Harold Morowitz points out, this means that we need to distinguish between two kinds of cellular simplicity.6 Internal simplicity means that the biochemistry of the organism's internal environment is simple, while ecological simplicity means that the organism makes few chemical demands on its external environment.<br><br>From the ecological point of view, the simplest bacteria are the cyanobacteria, the ancestors of blue-green algae, which are also among the oldest bacteria, their chemical traces being present in the earliest fossils. Some of these blue-green bacteria are able to build up their organic compounds entirely from carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen and pure minerals. Interestingly, their great ecological simplicity seems to require a certain amount of internal biochemical complexity.<br><br>The Ecological Perspective<br><br>The relationship between internal and ecological simplicity is still poorly understood, partly because most biologists are not used to the ecological perspective. As Morowitz explains:<br><br>Sustained life is a property of an ecological system rather than a single organism or species. Traditional biology has tended to concentrate attention on individual organisms rather than on the biological continuum. The origin of life is thus looked for as a unique event in which an organism arises from the surrounding milieu. A more ecologically balanced point of view would examine the proto-ecological cycles and subsequent chemical systems that must have developed and flourished while objects resembling organisms appeared.<br><br>No individual organism can exist in isolation. Animals depend on the photosynthesis of plants for their energy needs; plants depend on the carbon dioxide produced by animals, as well as on the nitrogen fixed by the bacteria at their roots; and together plants, animals and microorganisms regulate the entire biosphere and maintain the conditions conducive to life. According to the Gaia theory of James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis, the evolution of the first living organisms went hand in hand with the transformation of the planetary surface from an inorganic environment to a self-regulating biosphere. "In that sense," writes Harold Morowitz, "life is a property of planets rather than of individual organisms."<br><br>Life Defined in Terms of DNA<br><br>Let us now return to the question "What is life?" and ask: How does a bacterial cell work? What are its defining characteristics? When we look at a cell under an electron microscope, we notice that its metabolic processes involve special macromolecules--very large molecules consisting of long chains of hundreds of atoms. Two kinds of these macromolecules are found in all cells: proteins and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).<br><br>In the bacterial cell, there are essentially two types of proteins--enzymes, which act as catalysts of various metabolic processes, and structural proteins, which are part of the cell structure. In higher organisms, there are also many other types of proteins with specialized functions, such as the antibodies of the immune system or the hormones.<br><br>Since most metabolic processes are catalyzed by enzymes and enzymes are specified by genes, the cellular processes are genetically controlled, which gives them great stability. The RNA molecules serve as messengers, delivering coded information for the synthesis of enzymes from the DNA, thus establishing the critical link between the cell's genetic and metabolic features.<br><br>DNA is also responsible for the cell's self-replication, which is a crucial characteristic of life. Without it, any accidentally formed structures would have decayed and disappeared, and life could never have evolved. This overriding importance of DNA might suggest that it should be identified as the single defining characteristic of life. We might simply say: "Living systems are chemical systems that contain DNA."<br><br>The problem with this definition is that dead cells also contain DNA. Indeed, DNA molecules may be preserved for hundreds, even thousands, of years after the organism dies. A spectacular example of such a case was reported a few years ago, when scientists in Germany succeeded in identifying the precise gene sequence in DNA from a Neanderthal skull--bones that had been dead for over 100,000 years! Thus, the presence of DNA alone is not sufficient to define life. At the very least, our definition would have to be modified to: "Living systems are chemical systems that contain DNA, and which are not dead." But then we would be saying, essentially, "a living system is a system that is alive"--a mere tautology.<br><br>This little exercise shows us that the molecular structures of the cell are not sufficient for the definition of life. We also need to describe the cell's metabolic processes--in other words, the patterns of relationships between the macromolecules. In this approach, we focus on the cell as a whole rather than on its parts. According to biochemist Pier Luigi Luisi, whose special field of research is molecular evolution and the origin of life, these two approaches--the "DNA-centered" view and the "cell-centered" view--represent two main philosophical and experimental streams in life sciences today.<br><br>Membranes--The Foundation of Cellular Identity<br><br>Let us now look at the cell as a whole. A cell is characterized, first of all, by a boundary (the cell membrane) which discriminates between the system--the "self," as it were--and its environment. Within this boundary, there is a network of chemical reactions (the cell's metabolism) by which the system sustains itself.<br><br>Most cells have other boundaries besides membranes, such as rigid cell walls or capsules. These are common features in many kinds of cells, but only membranes are a universal feature of cellular life. Since its beginning, life on Earth has been associated with water. Bacteria move in water, and the metabolism inside their membranes takes place in a watery environment. In such fluid surroundings, a cell could never persist as a distinct entity without a physical barrier against free diffusion. The existence of membranes is therefore an essential condition for cellular life. Membranes are not only a universal characteristic of life, but also display the same type of structure throughout the living world. We shall see that the molecular details of this universal membrane structure hold important clues about the origin of life.<br><br>A membrane is very different from a cell wall. Whereas cell walls are rigid structures, membranes are always active, opening and closing continually, keeping certain substances out and letting others in. The cell's met...</p><h2>The Old Wives&#39; Tale (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)</h2><p>Victorian novel set in the pottery district of Staffordshire and France during the Siege of Paris</p><p>With a New Introduction by Francine Prose<br>Commentary by Rebecca West, W.

Bennett traces the sisters' lives from childhood in their father's drapery shop in provincial Bursley, England, during the mid-Victorian era, through their married lives, to the modern industrial age, when they are reunited as old women. The setting moves from the Five Towns of Staffordshire to exotic and cosmopolitan Paris, while the action moves from the subdued domestic routine of the Baines household to the siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br>"Like Wordsworth, [Arnold Bennett] has triumphed over the habitual; he has not let it disguise the particle of beauty from him."--Rebecca West</p><p>ARNOLD BENNETT (1867-1931) looked to Flaubert, Maupassant, and Balzac for inspiration in the fashioning of his own acutely realistic novels, including his masterpiece, The Old Wives' Tale (1908). His first novel was A Man from the North (1898), and he is also known for his Clayhanger trilogy (1910-16).</p><p>The author of thirteen books of fiction, FRANCINE PROSE is a <br>fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities and the New York Public Library's Center for Scholars and Writers.</p>ARNOLD BENNETT was born in Staffordshire on May 27, 1867, the son of a solictor. Rather than following his father into the law, Bennett moved to London at the age of twenty-one and began a career in writing . His first novel, &#34;The Man from the North,&#34; was published in 1898 during a spell as editor of a periodical -- throughout his life journalism supplemented his writing career. In 1902 Bennett moved to Paris, married, and published some of his best known novels, most of which were set in The Potteries district where he grew up: &#34;Anna of the Five Towns &#34;(1902), &#34;The Old Wives Tale&#34; (1908), and the &#34;Clayhanger&#34; series (1910-1918). These works, as well as several successful plays, established him both in Europe and America as one of the most popular and acclaimed writers of his era. Bennett returned to England in 1912, and during the First World War worked for Lord Beaverbrook in the Ministry of Information. In 1921, separated from his first wife, he fell in love with an actress, Dorothy Cheston, with whom he had a child. He received the James Tait Black Award for his novel &#34;Riceyman Steps&#34; in 1923.

John Mosier, who visited all the major battlefields, describes and analyzes campaigns that are routinely neglected or ignored and shows why conventional accounts of such major battles as Verdun are incorrect. He explains how German tactics, weapons, training, and leadership were consistently superior, and why the endless, ineffective attacks of the French and British with inferior weapons and battle tactics of the previous century resulted in mindless slaughter and defeat. Mosier also discusses the major military leaders on both sides ' including Joffre, Petain, Foch, Gallieni, French, Haig, Wilson, Moltke, Ludendorff, Falkenhayn, Mudra, and Pershing.</p><p>The French and British military controlled, suppressed, and manipulated all battlefield reports. German losses were magnified; failures became successes, defeats victories. Allied intelligence was grossly inaccurate and inadequate, and the result was a distorted picture of what was really happening. Absorbing and persuasive, <em>The Myth of the Great War</em> is a striking new assessment of the military realities of World War I.</p></p><p><p>John Mosier is the author of <em>The Myth of the Great War.</em> He is full professor of English at Loyola University in New Orleans, where, as chair of the English Department and associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, he taught primarily European literature and film. His background as a military historian dates from his role in developing an interdisciplinary curriculum for the study of the two world wars, a program funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. From 1989 to 1992 he edited the New Orleans Review. He lives in Jefferson, Louisiana.</p>In reading and analyzing the great body of tactical and operational literature published by French soldiers and academicians in the interwar period, Loyola English professor and film critic Mosier, who is fluent in French, brings to light a perspective generally neglected by historians who prefer to tell the war's story from a German or British view. For most of WWI, Mosier reminds us, it was the French who held most of the front and did most of the dying. In contrast to the German army's systematic success at technical and tactical innovation, Mosier finds that French and British generals "solved" battlefield problems by throwing shells and bodies at them, then concealing the gruesome results from their governments and their people. Allied victory, he argues, depended on an American Expeditionary Force whose commander, Gen. John J. Pershing, saw through the pretensions of his counterparts in command, and insisted on fighting the war in his own way. While Mosier's argument is eloquently presented, scholars of the period will find it consistently spoiled by overstatement; the German army of WWI as described by most historians is nothing like the tempered and perfected instrument described in these pages, and Mosier's notion of Verdun as a German victory was not likely to be found in the ranks or the headquarters of the divisions who fought there. Still, this is the best narrative account in English of the Franco-German combat in central and in southern France from the aftermath of the Marne in 1914 to the end of Verdun in 1916. Buffs and scholars will take note, but the detailed maps, charts and technical focus will put off generalists. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Those Who Leave And Those Whostay (Thorndike Basic)</h2><p>The incredible story continues in book three of the critically acclaimed Neapolitan Novels! <br> Since the publication of My Brilliant Friend, the first of the Neapolitan novels, Elena Ferrante's fame as one of our most compelling, insightful, and stylish contemporary authors has grown enormously. She has gained admirers among authors--Jhumpa Lahiri, Elizabeth Strout, Claire Messud, to name a few--and critics--James Wood, John Freeman, Eugenia Williamson, for example. But her most resounding success has undoubtedly been with readers, who have discovered in Ferrante a writer who speaks with great power and beauty of the mysteries of belonging, human relationships, love, family, and friendship. <br> In this third Neapolitan novel, Elena and Lila, the two girls whom readers first met in My Brilliant Friend, have become women. Lila married at sixteen and has a young son; she has left her husband and the comforts her marriage brought and now works as a common laborer. Elena has left the neighborhood, earned her college degree, and published a successful novel, all of which has opened the doors to a world of learned interlocutors and richly furnished salons. Both women have attempted are pushing against the walls of a prison that would have seen them living a life of misery, ignorance and submission. They are afloat on the great sea of opportunities that opened up during the nineteen-seventies. Yet they are still very much bound to each other by a strong, unbreakable bond.<br></p><p>Elena Ferrante was born in Naples, Italy.

More than likely it was his brush with Beatles fame that landed him this publishing contract, but it is his writing talent and depth of personal story that makes this spiritual memoir rock. Mansfield jumps back and forth, from his childlike fear of landing in London for the first time to his mature and reflective life in the California fishing community of Bodega Bay (seen in Alfred Hitchcock's <i>The Birds</i>). Beatles fans will love all the insider's scoop about the Fabulous Four, although the more recent information about Mansfield's friendship with the currently drug-free and sober Ringo Starr seems the most fresh and intriguing.<p> Occasionally the Beatles references seem overdone, such as the numerous chapter headings named after Beatles songs or the conspicuous song lyrics stuck into the middle of the narrative. For example, when the 50-something Ringo Starr makes a deal with the 50-something Mansfield that will make the narrator globs of money, he writes, "It was nice to get a little help from a friend!" Biblical quotes are also sprinkled throughout. Take this memoir as a long and winding road or a joyful spiritual romp that travels here, there, and everywhere but ultimately leads to the riches of contemplative living. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Ken Mansfield has been record producer to many famous recording artists.

A Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist.<br></p><p>Geoffrey Moorhouse is the author of nineteen books, including Calcutta, Imperial City, and Hell&#39;s Foundations. He was chief features writer at the Manchester Guardian for twelve years, until 1970. A Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, he lives in North Yorkshire, England.The rigors of Irish monasticism in the medieval period, well told by travel writer Moorhouse (On the Other Side, 1991; Hell's Foundations, 1992; etc.). The first half of the book is an imaginative reconstruction of life in an Irish monastery on the secluded rock-island of Skellig Michael from its founding in 588 to its dissolution in 1222. Moorhouse uses fictional vignettes to enliven the text. Each chapter is a well-chosen window onto a significant figure or event in the monastery's history--an 824 attack by Viking raiders, for example. In these fictional glimpses, we see the larger picture of Irish monasticism's evolution from a rigorously austere island faith to a less zealous, Romanized religion. Skellig Michael, perilously located on a sheer cliff rising from the ocean, began as one of the most ascetic of the Irish monasteries. Gradually, however, the population of monks began to dwindle, and the last fictionalized chapter shows the abbot and his aging disciples rowing their way back to the security of the mainland. The first half of the book is so intriguing and beautifully written that the second, a more traditional historical treatment of Irish monasticism, arranged topically, pales by comparison. Some of the discussions are absorbing, though; in one instance, Moorhouse explores the theme of syncretism, arguing that early Irish Catholicism, rather than eradicating pagan Celtic rituals, incorporated them into monastic life. This eclectic borrowing was able to continue for centuries because of Ireland's geographical remoteness from the centralizing forces of Rome. Due to accommodation with a Celtic spring ritual, Easter was dated differently than in Rome, a discrepancy that continued until Rome demanded conformity in the early 8th century. An uneven work, then, more fascinating in its first, fictionalized half than in the rigorous explications of the second, and one that might have worked better presented purely as a novel.

For several decades, Lasch wrote some of the most compelling and erudite essays in American letters, eschewing the wastrel and faddish trends that afflict much contemporary criticism. The end of his work was nothing less than the reshaping of our own self-understanding. Lasch attempted to make clear to his thinking readers that there is greater purpose in human life than "making it" either in business or the bedroom, combating the powerful drives of greed, lust, and pride in what he saw as our consumerist culture. In <i>Women and the Common Life</i>, Lasch directs his attention toward issues of marriage, feminism, and the men's movement in nine succinct essays that focus on the latent ideals of love and commitment. Too smart to lapse into false nostalgia for set gender roles or "traditional"family structures, Lasch rejects both the Right's unthinking conservatism as well as the Left's loose talk of "oppression" and "liberation." Instead, Lasch challenges gender theorists to consider their complicity in making market success a dominant social and political goal and to reappraise the cultural accomplishment of companionate marriage, which Lasch describes as a "union of desire and esteem." The foreword by Lasch's daughter--the editor of this volume--supplies a moving account of Lasch's last days and his influence on her own work.Christopher Lasch (1932&#x2013;1994), professor of history at the University of Rochester, wrote, among many other works, The True and Only Heaven: Progress and Its Critics and the best-selling Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy.</p><h2>Obadiah, Jonah, Micah: An Introduction and Commentary (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)</h2><p><em>Obadiah's oracle against Edom.</em><em>Jonah's mission to the city of Ninevah.</em><em>Micah's message to Samaria and Jerusalem.</em>The texts of these minor but important prophets receive a fresh and penetrating analysis in this introduction and commentary.

Now, Bill Roemer, the FBI crime expert who&#39;s had more face-to-face confrontations with mobsters than anyone in law enforcement history, tells his electrifying life story. From his key role in the lives of John and Robert Kennedy, Frank Sinatra, Phyllis McGuire, and Marilyn Monroe, to the run ins with Anthony &#34;Tony Batters&#34; Accardo, Murray &#34;The Camel&#34; Humphreys and Jackie Cerone that made him the nemesis of the Chicago mob, here is a chillingly authentic account that ranks as one of the finest chronicles in true crime.</p><p>"Roemer does an admirable job of bluntly recreating the inner workings of Chicago's underworld and the FBI's methods of fighting them....A revealing memoir that pulls no punches in recalling the triumphs -- and, at times, foul-ups -- that characterized Mr. Roemer's remarkable career."<p>The New York Times Book Review</p>The author, who runs a private investigating agency in Tucson that specializes in organized crime, spent 30 years as an FBI agent, mostly in Chicago. He writes that although innumerable opportunities to rise in the hierarchy came his way, he preferred to remain on the street, taking on the mob. Roemer's particular concern as an agent was to track corrupt public officials who were vital to the success of the "family." Here he recalls his mob dealings, from 1950 to 1980, with Sam Giancana, Murray Humphreys (successor to Capone lieutenant Jake Guzik), Tony Accardo and dozens of others. Distinguishing between "good" bad guys who could be trusted, and "bad" bad guys, he shows that some gangland figures virtually became his friends. His intimate knowledge of them enriches the book. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bum Rap (Jake Lassiter Legal Thrillers)</h2><p><p>NFL linebacker-turned-lawyer Jake Lassiter has had it with shifty clients, dirty prosecutors, and a legal system out of whack.

From childhood onward, she senses the presence of unfamiliar gods in her life; the bright lady, and the man with a seedling cupped in his palm. Raised in the wilderness by her reclusive mother, it isn't until she comes of age that Moirin learns how illustrious, if mixed, her heritage is. The great granddaughter of Alais the Wise, child of the Maghuin Donn, and a cousin of the Cruarch of Alba, Moirin learns her father was a D'Angeline priest dedicated to serving Naamah, goddess of desire. <br><br>After Moirin undergoes the rites of adulthood, she finds divine acceptance...on the condition that she fulfill an unknown destiny that lies somewhere beyond the ocean.

Beyond Terre d'Ange where she finds her father, in the far reaches of distant Ch'in, Moirin's skills are a true gift when facing the vengeful plans of an ambitious mage, a noble warrior princess desperate to save her father's throne, and the spirit of a celestial dragon.</p><p>Jacqueline Carey's previous publications include various short stories, essays, a nonfiction book <em>Angels: Celestial Spirits in Legend and Art</em>, as well as the nationally bestselling series <em>Kushiel's Legacy</em>.<br> http://www.jacquelinecarey.com/The seventh installment in Carey's bestselling Kushiel series (after 2008's <i>Kushiel's Mercy</i>) follows its youthful protagonist, Moirim, from bed to bed as she worships sexuality goddess Naamah. Following a tragic affair, Moirim travels to Terre d'Ange, this world's France. There she takes a variety of lovers, from the aristocratic occultist Raphael de Mereliot to Queen Jehanne herself. The elderly but wise Lo Feng befriends Moirim and leads her to the distant land of Ch'in and the true love of her life, the gruff but affectionate ex-bandit Bao. Moirim and her friends endeavor to save the Ch'in emperor's daughter Snow Tiger from a curse, but their efforts come at terrible costs, not least of which is the certainty of multiple sequels. Carey's triumph as a writer lies in her ability to turn these stock&#x2014;nearly stereotyped&#x2014;components into an engaging, fascinating novel. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Not like in Berlin, where winter is more a rite of passage than a season: you're not a true Berliner until you've survived the bitter experience of an interminable Prussian winter; that famous dancing bear you see on the city's coat of arms is just trying to keep himself warm.<br><br> The Hotel Ruhl was normally one of the last hotels in Nice to close because it had a casino and people like to gamble whatever the weather. Maybe they should have opened a casino in the nearby Hotel Negresco-which the Ruhl resembled, except that the Negresco was closed and looked as if it might stay that way the following year. Some said they were going to turn it into apartments but the Negresco concierge-who was an acquaintance of mine, and a fearful snob-said the place had been sold to the daughter of a Breton butcher, and he wasn't usually wrong about these things. He was off to Bern for the winter and probably wouldn't be back. I was going to miss him but as I parked my car and crossed the Promenade des Anglais to the Hotel Ruhl I really wasn't thinking about that. Perhaps it was the cold night air and the barman's surplus ice cubes in the gutter but instead I was thinking about Germany. Or perhaps it was the sight of the two crew-cut golems standing outside the hotel's grand Mediterranean entrance, eating ice cream cones and wearing thick East German suits of the kind that are mass-produced like tractor parts and shovels. Just seeing those two thugs ought to have put me on my guard but I had something important on my mind; I was looking forward to meeting my wife, Elisabeth, who, out of the blue, had sent me a letter inviting me to dinner. We were separated, and she was living back in Berlin, but Elisabeth's handwritten letter-she had beautiful S&#x178;tterlin handwriting (banned by the Nazis)-spoke of her having come into a bit of money, which just might have explained how she could afford to be back on the Riviera and staying at the Ruhl, which is almost as expensive as the Angleterre or the Westminster. Either way I was looking forward to seeing her again with the blind faith of one who hoped reconciliation was on the cards. I'd already planned the short but graceful speech of forgiveness I was going to make. How much I missed her and thought we could still make a go of it-that kind of thing. Of course, a part of me was also braced for the possibility she might be there to tell me she'd met someone else and wanted a divorce. Still, it seemed like a lot of trouble to go to-it wasn't easy to travel from Berlin these days.<br><br> The hotel restaurant was on the top floor in one of the corner cupolas. It was perhaps the best in Nice, designed by Charles Dalmas. Certainly it was the most expensive. I hadn't ever eaten there but I'd heard the food was excellent and I was looking forward to my dinner. The m&#x2030;itre d' sidestepped his way across the beautiful Belle Epoque room, met me at the bookings lectern, and found my wife's name on the page. I was already glancing over his shoulder, searching the tables anxiously for Elisabeth and not finding her there yet, checking my watch and realizing that I was perhaps a little early. I wasn't really listening to the m&#x2030;itre d' as he informed me that my host had arrived, and I was halfway across the marble floor when I saw I was being ushered to a quiet corner table where a squat, tough-looking man was already working on a very large lobster and a bottle of white Burgundy. Recognizing him immediately, I turned on my heel only to find my exit blocked by two more apes who looked as if they might have climbed in through the open window, off one of the many palm trees on the Promenade.<br><br> "Don't leave yet," one of them said quietly in thick, Leipzig-accented German. "The comrade-general wouldn't like it."<br><br> For a moment I stood my ground, wondering if I could risk making a run for the door. But the two men, cut from the same crude mold as the two golems I'd seen by the hotel entrance, were more than a match for me.<br><br> "That's right," added the other. "So you'd best sit down like a good boy and avoid making a scene."<br><br> "Gunther," said a voice behind me, also speaking German. "Bernhard Gunther. Come over here and sit down, you old fascist. Don't be afraid." He laughed. "I'm not going to shoot you. It's a public place." I suppose he assumed that German speakers were at a premium in the Hotel Ruhl and he probably wouldn't have been wrong. "What could possibly happen to you in here? Besides, the food is excellent and the wine more so."<br><br> I turned again and took another look at the man who remained seated and was still applying himself to the lobster with his cracker and a pick, like a plumber changing the washer on a tap. He was wearing a better suit than his men-a blue pinstripe, tailor-made-and a patterned silk tie that could only have been bought in France. A tie like that would have cost a week's wages in the GDR and probably earned you a lot of awkward questions at the local police station, as would the large gold watch that flashed on his wrist like a miniature lighthouse as he gouged at the flesh of the lobster, which was the same color as the more abundant flesh of his powerful hands. His hair was still dark on top but cut so short against the sides of his wrecking ball of a head it looked like a priest's black zucchetto. He'd put on some weight since last I'd seen him, and he hadn't even started on the new potatoes, the mayonnaise, the asparagus tips, the salade ni oise, sweet cucumber pickles, and a plate of dark chocolate arranged on the table in front of him. With his boxer's physique he reminded me strongly of Martin Bormann, Hitler's deputy chief of staff; he was certainly every bit as dangerous.<br><br> I sat down, poured myself a glass of white wine, and tossed my cigarette case onto the table in front of me.<br><br> "General Erich Mielke," I said. "What an unexpected pleasure."<br><br> "I'm sorry about bringing you here under false pretenses. But I knew you wouldn't have come if I'd said it was I who was buying dinner."<br><br> "Is she all right? Elisabeth? Just tell me that and then I'll listen to whatever you have to say, General."<br><br> "Yes, she's fine."<br><br> "I take it she's not actually here in Nice."<br><br> "No, she's not. I'm sorry about that. But you'll be glad to know that she was most reluctant to write that letter. I had to explain that the alternative would have been so much more painful, for you at least. So please don't hold that letter against her. She wrote it for the best of reasons." Mielke lifted an arm and snapped his fingers at the waiter. "Have something to eat. Have some wine. I drink very little myself but I'm told this is the best. Anything you like. I insist. The Ministry of State Security is paying. Only, please don't smoke. I hate the smell of cigarettes, especially when I'm eating."<br><br> "I'm not hungry, thanks."<br><br> "Of course you are. You're a Berliner. We don't have to be hungry to eat. The war taught us to eat when there's food on the table."<br><br> "Well, there's plenty of food on this table. Are we expecting anyone else? The Red Army, perhaps?"<br><br> "I like to see lots of food when I'm eating, even if I don't eat any of it. It's not just a man's stomach that needs filling. It's his senses, too."<br><br> I picked up the bottle and inspected the label.<br><br> "Corton-Charlemagne. I approve. Nice to see that an old communist like you can still appreciate a few of the finer things in life, General. This wine must be the most expensive on the list."<br><br> "I do, and it most certainly is."<br><br> I drained the glass and poured myself another. It was excellent.<br><br> The waiter approached nervously, as if he'd already felt the edge of Mielke's tongue.<br><br> "We'll have two juicy steaks," said Mielke, speaking good French-the result, I imagined, of his two years spent in a French prison camp before and during the war. "No, better still, we'll have the Chateaubriand. And make it very bloody."<br><br> The waiter went away.<br><br> "Is it just steak you prefer that way?" I said. "Or everything else as well?"<br><br> "Still got that sense of humor, Gunther. It beats me how you've stayed alive for this long."<br><br> "The French are a little more tolerant of these things than they are in what you laughingly call the Democratic Republic of Germany. Tell me, General, when is the communist government going to dissolve the people and elect another?"<br><br> "The people?" Mielke laughed, and breaking off from his lobster for a moment, placed a piece of chocolate into his mouth, almost as if it were a matter of indifference what he was eating just as long as it was something not easily obtained in the GDR. "They rarely know what's best for them. Nearly fourteen million Germans voted for Hitler in March 1932, making the Nazis the largest party in the Reichstag. Do you honestly believe they had a clue what was best for them? No, of course not. Nobody did. All the people care about is a regular pay packet, cigarettes, and beer."<br><br> "I expect that's why twenty thousand East German refugees were crossing into the Federal Republic every month-at least until you imposed your so-called special regime with its restricted zone and your protective strip. They were in search of better beer and cigarettes and perhaps the chance to complain a little without fear of the consequences."<br><br> "Who was it said that none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who believe they are free?"<br><br> "It was Goethe. And you misquote him. He said that none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free."<br><br> "In my book, they are one and the same."<br><br> "That would be the one book you've read, then."<br><br> "You're a romantic fool. I forget that about you, sometimes. Look, Gunther, most people's idea of freedom is to write something rude on a lavatory wall. My own belief is that the people are lazy and prefer to leave the business of government to the government. However, it's important that the people don't place too great a burden on those in charge of things. Hence, my presence here in France. Generally speaking I prefer to go hunting. But I often come here around this time of year to get away from my responsibilities. I like to play a little baccarat."<br><br> "That's a high-risk game. But then you always were a gambler."<br><br> "You want to know the really great thing about gambling here?" He grinned. "Most of the time, I lose. If there were still such decadent things as casinos in the GDR I'm afraid the croupiers would always make sure I won. Winning is only fun if you can lose. I used to go to the one in Baden-Baden but the last time I was there I was recognized and couldn't go again. So now I come to Nice. Or sometimes Le Touquet. But I prefer Nice. The weather is a little more reliable here than on the Atlantic coast."<br><br> "Somehow I don't believe that's all you're here for."<br><br> "You're right."<br><br> "So what the hell do you want?"<br><br> "You remember that business a few months back, with Somerset Maugham and our mutual friends Harold Hennig and Anne French. You almost managed to screw up a good operation there."<br><br> Mielke was referring to a Stasi plot to discredit Roger Hollis, the deputy director of MI5-the British domestic counterintelligence and security agency. The real plan had been to leave Hollis smelling of roses after the bogus Stasi plot was revealed.<br><br> "It was very good of you to tie up that loose end for us," said Mielke. "It was you who killed Hennig, wasn't it?"<br><br> I didn't answer but we both knew this was true; I'd shot Harold Hennig dead in the house Anne French had been renting in Villefranche and done my very best to frame her for it. Since then the French police had asked me all sorts of questions about her, but that was all I knew. As far as I was aware, Anne French remained safely back in England.<br><br> "Well, for the sake of argument, let's just say it was you," said Mielke. He finished the piece of chocolate he was eating, forked some pickled cucumber into his mouth, and then swallowed a mouthful of white Burgundy, all of which persuaded me that his taste buds were every bit as corrupt as his politics and morals. "The fact is that Hennig's days were numbered anyway. As are Anne's. The operation to discredit Hollis really only looks good if we try to eliminate her, too-as befits someone who betrayed us. And that's especially important now that the French are trying to have her extradited back here to face trial for Hennig's murder. Needless to say, that just can't be allowed to happen. Which is where you come in, Gunther."<br><br> "Me?" I shrugged. "Let me get this straight. You're asking me to kill Anne French?"<br><br> "Precisely. Except that I'm not asking. The fact is that you agreeing to kill Anne French is a condition of remaining alive yourself."<br><br> Two<br><br> October 1956<br><br> I estimated once that the Gestapo had employed less than fifty thousand officers to keep an eye on eighty million Germans, but from what I'd read and heard about the GDR, the Stasi employed at least twice that number-to say nothing of their civilian informants or spylets who, rumor had it, amounted to one in ten of the population-to keep an eye on just seventeen million Germans. As deputy head of the Stasi, Erich Mielke was one of the most powerful men in the GDR. And as might have been expected of such a man, he'd already anticipated all my objections to such a distasteful mission as the one he had described and was ready to argue them down with the brute force of one who is used to getting his way with people who are themselves authoritarian and assertive. I had the feeling that Mielke might have grabbed me by the throat or banged my head on the dinner table and, of course, violence was a vital part of his character; as a young communist cadre in Berlin he'd participated in the infamous murder of two uniformed policemen.</p><h2>Divided by God: America&#39;s Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It</h2><p><b>A brilliant and urgent appraisal of one of the most profound conflicts of our time</b><br><br>Even before George W. Bush gained reelection by wooing religiously devout "values voters," it was clear that church-state matters in the United States had reached a crisis. With<i> Divided by God</i>, Noah Feldman shows that the crisis is as old as this country--and looks to our nation's past to show how it might be resolved. <br><br>Today more than ever, ours is a religiously diverse society: Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist as well as Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish. And yet more than ever, committed Christians are making themselves felt in politics and culture.<br><br>What are the implications of this paradox? To answer this question, Feldman makes clear that again and again in our nation's history diversity has forced us to redraw the lines in the church-state divide. In vivid, dramatic chapters, he describes how we as a people have resolved conflicts over the Bible, the Pledge of Allegiance, and the teaching of evolution through appeals to shared values of liberty, equality, and freedom of conscience. And he proposes a brilliant solution to our current crisis, one that honors our religious diversity while respecting the long-held conviction that religion and state should not mix. <br><br><i>Divided by God</i> speaks to the headlines, even as it tells the story of a long-running conflict that has made the American people who we are. <br></p><p>In Divided By God, Noah Feldman examines the unique, fascinating balance the United States has pursued for well over 200 years now -- the attempt at democratic government by the people in a country made up of many religions, and many highly religious people. The novel principle enshrined to help make this a success was strong separation of church from state. The strain on the system has never been greater as polarization grows over the many hot-button topics of our day. Feldman also observes how the stakes have been raised in the last 50 years as the forces of secularism have fought a largely successful battle to remove religious symbolism from the public sphere, while at the same time the growing tide of religious conservatism has managed to forge a surprisingly close church-state relationship through government funding of religious priorities (faith-based initiatives and school vouchers, for example.) <p> Feldman, a law professor at New York University, delivers a timely book that attempts to move the discussion past rhetoric, by a careful examination of the history of church-state separation. The book's lively, conversational writing makes for a fascinating journey, starting with a precise analysis of exactly why our founding fathers debated and finally agreed to formally separate church and state, and then tracking the tests and challenges that separation has stood over the last two centuries. Perhaps the most refreshing current throughout is Feldman's lack of partisan bias, and his respect and understanding of the values, fears and goals that successive generations have brought to all sides of this never-ending debate. </p><p> It is that lack of partisanship that makes his conclusion all the more powerful -- a call to move beyond a battlefield where the secular and religious forces aggressively pursue their own mutually exclusive goals, and instead to seek a deeper understanding of what values we all hold in common, and to recognize the importance of engaging in constructive debate in order to find and define that commonality together. --<i>Ed Dobeas</i></p><b>Noah Feldman</b>, who teaches law at New York University, is the author of <i>After Jihad</i> and <i>What We Owe Iraq</i>.

Among other things, Freud claims in the book that Moses was an Egyptian, that he derived the notion of monotheism from Egyptian concepts, and that after he introduced monotheism to the Jews he was killed by them. Since these historical and ethnographic assumptions have been generally rejected by biblical scholars, anthropologists, and historians of religion, the book has increasingly been approached psychoanalytically, as a psychological document of Freud&#39;s inner life - of his allegedly unresolved Oedipal complex and ambivalence over his Jewish identity. In &#34;Freud&#39;s Moses&#34; an historian of the Jews brings a new perspective to this puzzling work. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud&#39;s text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud&#39;s intentions in writing &#34;Moses and Monotheism&#34;. He presents the work as Freud&#39;s psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche - his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi&#39;s exploration of Freud&#39;s last work provides a reappraisal of Freud&#39;s feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a &#34;Jewish&#34; science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud&#39;s identity as a &#34;godless Jew&#34;.</p><p>Delivered as a series of lectures at Columbia, Yale, Smith, and in Paris, this eloquent, scholarly, and perceptive study explores the significance of Moses and Monotheism, Freud's last major work, written in 1934 when the impending Holocaust led him to reflect on his own Jewish identity and on psychoanalysis as a ``Jewish science.'' Yerushalmi (Professor and Director, Center for Israel and Jewish Studies/Columbia) treats Moses and Monotheism as a historical as well as a psychological document, tracing its origins to a 1822 text by Ernst Sellin, the first to claim that Moses was an Egyptian who gave monotheism to the Jews, rescued them, and in turn was slain by them in retaliation against the strict regulations he imposed on them. The murder of the father, the repression, guilt, and rehabilitation or return became part of the Jewish character, according to Freud--an inherited characteristic. In the last chapter, a dramatic monologue with Freud, Yerushalmi applies the theory to Freud himself, a secular Jew, with Freud as Moses and his father as the god who gave him a sacred text, a personally inscribed Bible with the implied mandate that he accept his Jewish heritage. In ``deferred obedience,'' he writes Moses and Monotheism and, identifying with an Egyptian rather than a Jewish Moses, expiates his guilt for rejecting his father. The text in turn becomes the ``Torah'' to the psychoanalytic movement in its ``diaspora'' following WW II. In the end, however, being a Jew to Freud was ``something miraculous'' and ``inaccessible to any analysis.'' A stimulating study (including Freud's original manuscript and unpublished letters to his father, all in German) that has ranging implications for students of Judaism, religion, Freud, and the psychoanalytic movement. Cautious, penetrating, well- focused, it raises many interesting and original questions. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Unlike any earlier films, Godard's work shifts fluidly from fiction to documentary, from criticism to art. The man himself also projects shifting images--cultural hero, fierce loner, shrewd businessman. Hailed by filmmakers as a--if not the--key influence on cinema, Godard has entered the modern canon, a figure as mysterious as he is indispensable.<br>In <i>Everything Is Cinema</i>, critic Richard Brody has amassed hundreds of interviews to demystify the elusive director and his work. Paying as much attention to Godard's technical inventions as to the political forces of the postwar world, Brody traces an arc from the director's early critical writing, through his popular success with Breathless, to the grand vision of his later years. He vividly depicts Godard's wealthy conservative family, his fluid politics, and his tumultuous dealings with women and fellow New Wave filmmakers.<br><i>Everything Is Cinema</i> confirms Godard's greatness and shows decisively that his films have left their mark on screens everywhere.</p><p>Richard Brody, a film critic and editor at <i>The New Yorker</i>, is also an independent filmmaker who lives in New York City. <i>Everything Is Cinema</i> is his first book.Chapter One<br>"WE DO NOT THINK, WE ARE THOUGHT" <p></p>IN THE SECOND EDITION, DATED JUNE 1950, of A THIN newspaper-like magazine published in Paris, La Gazette du cin�ma, a nineteen-year-old writer made a modest debut. Jean-Luc Godard&#x2019;s article, simply titled "Joseph Mankiewicz," was a short and breezy overview of that director&#x2019;s career, though, as in the following reference to the director&#x2019;s recent film, A Letter to Three Wives, it was devoted less to his films than to Mankiewicz himself: " &#x2018;One can judge a woman&#x2019;s past by her present,&#x2019; Mankiewicz says somewhere: this letter to three married women is also three letters to the same woman, one whom the director probably loved." <p></p>In an eight-paragraph jaunt, the young writer lightly sketched a conception of the cinema that was as intensely personal as it was revolutionary: he suggested that films are one with the world offscreen. Casually, and without any theoretical fuss, he treated films as something more than creations that bore the mark of their makers; he considered them inseparable from the lives of their creators. <p></p>Godard&#x2019;s piece on the front page of the next issue of La Gazette, "For a Political Cinema," is as provocative now as it seemed at the time. In it, he put forth an aesthetic framework that daringly overrode basic ideological distinctions in the name of specifically cinematic values. <p></p>One afternoon, at the end of the Gaumont newsreel, we opened our eyes wide with pleasure: young German Communists were marching in a May Day celebration. Suddenly, space was only the lines of lips and bodies, time only the raising of fists in the air...By the sole force of propaganda that was animating them, these young people were beautiful.1 <p></p>Godard compared these young people to St. Sebastian and to the youths in classical Greek sculpture: the state of possession, albeit an intellectual one, that resulted from the thrall of ideology seemed to him to resemble religious devotion and thus to confer on its subject a transcendent serenity. He added that in Soviet films, "the actor infallibly returns to what he originally was, a priest. The Fall of Berlin and The Battle of Stalingrad are coronation masses." Godard treated expressions of Communist and Christian faith as equivalent, and admired the similar power of Nazi propaganda films, which had so recently been pressed upon Parisian moviegoers by German occupiers: <p></p>We could not forget Hitler Youth Quex, certain passages of films by Leni Riefenstahl, several shocking newsreels from the Occupation, the maleficent ugliness of The Eternal Jew. It is not the first time that art is born of constraint. <p></p>Godard praised these films not for their political message but for their psychology: they depicted people under the influence, and it hardly mattered whether that influence was political or religious. He took all fanaticisms to be alike and to be equally beautiful. Without equating the far left and the far right politically, Godard equated them aesthetically. <p></p>The essay ends with an exhortation: "French filmmakers in search of scripts, how have you unfortunate souls not yet filmed the assessment of taxes, the death of Philippe Henriod [sic], the wonderful life of Danielle Casanova?" Henriot, the Minister of Information in the Vichy government and a frequent and familiar orator on French radio under occupation, was killed in 1944 by Resistance fighters. Casanova, the founder of a Communist youth newspaper in the 1930s, was a Resistance fighter who died at Auschwitz. Godard endorsed as equally cinematically fertile the actions of a collaborator, of a resister, and ordinary parliamentary infighters, and he took the adventures and anecdotes that arose in the course of contemporary and recent history to be the cinema&#x2019;s natural subject. The passions to which the characters in such films would bear witness were those that belonged to the real world, as verified by the reality from which they derived. The cinematic fictions that the young Godard dreamed of arose from the documentary impulse. <p></p>Moreover, his idealistic depiction of the young fanatic was a touching, if oblique, self-portrait. He was leading a life of singular and exalted purpose: his monomaniacal fervor was ignited by movies, and he gave remarkably definitive expression to it in the following issue of La Gazette. <p></p>The October 1950 edition featured a brief note by "H.L."&#x2014;Hans Lucas, "Jean-Luc" in German, a pseudonym that Godard occasionally adopted through 1955&#x2014;on a documentary film about Alexander Calder&#x2019;s mobiles. One mercurial sentence sums up with a self-revealing clarity the adolescent Godard&#x2019;s relation to the cinema: "At the cinema, we do not think, we are thought."2 This observation was less an avowal of passivity than of the will to self-transformation through movies. It indicates Godard&#x2019;s consuming submission to cinema and the extent to which he experienced it as a personal epiphany, indeed a transfiguration. Godard had reached the essence of the experience at once, and conveyed it in an unabashed confession. In a single aphorism, he broke down the barriers of aesthetic distance and contemplation that separate the cinema, its viewers, and its makers. At the earliest stage of his work, Godard&#x2019;s existence and that of the cinema were already fused. <p></p>These three articles delineate a coherent and comprehensive cinematic philosophy, one which Godard would realize and rework in a wide variety of forms in a filmmaking career that began in 1954 and continues to this day. The ideas that they sketch are the unity of the filmmaker with the film, the inseparability of both from the social world at large, the credence of a devout moviegoer in the reality of the world as presented in the cinema, and the aesthetic fecundity of this fanatical submission. The viewer who was "thought" at the cinema was Godard himself; the filmmaker who was one with his film would be Godard himself; and his films would be the seemingly infinite variations on the theme of his singular faith in the cinema and in its ability to preserve and to reflect both the reality of the filmmaker and of his times through the intersection of personal stories and political history. <p></p>But each of these principles came with a price tag. Godard&#x2019;s submission to the cinema risked alienation from life. Films conceived as the expression of fanatical devotion to the cinema risked becoming a closed circuit of self-satisfied self-reference to the exclusion of reality. The identification of the film and the filmmaker risked the creation of a cult of personality that would detract attention from the filmmaker&#x2019;s work. And the avidly omnivorous, ideologically indeterminate recording of political currents ran the risk of detachment and ambiguity. Over time, Godard would recognize all of these risks and, in his work and his life, would attempt to confront and to overcome them. <p></p>THE STORY OF Jean-Luc Godard&#x2019;s work is one of a conversion to the secular religion of art and, specifically, to the art of cinema. For this art form, for this sort of passion, the holy city was, and remains, Paris. <p></p>The movies started in France, with the work of the Lumi�re brothers,3 and the special relationship of Paris to the movies is in large part due to that city&#x2019;s central role in French civilization. For France, Paris is three things in one: it is the country&#x2019;s New York, Washington, D.C., and Hollywood&#x2014;the cultural, political, and cinematic capital. The three domains are much more strongly interconnected in France than in the United States, and activity in any one of the three fields is quickly reflected in the other two. As a result, in France the movie business has also been, all along, both a strain of high art and a sensitive political barometer. <p></p>French filmmakers participated in, and often emerged from, literary circles, and Parisian artists took a serious interest in the movies almost from their inception. It was the French critic Ricciotto Canudo who called the cinema the "sixth art" in a 1911 essay (and the "seventh art" in 1919). Charlie Chaplin and D. W. Griffith were French cultural heroes as early as 1916, and artists of all sorts, especially the surrealists, took the cinema very seriously. Jean Cocteau made a film in 1930; Salvador Dali collaborated with Luis Bu�uel on Un Chien andalou and L&#x2019;Age d&#x2019;or; the film director Sacha Guitry was first a famous playwright; the greatest French prewar filmmaker, Jean Renoir, who made his first film in 1925, was the son of Auguste Renoir, the artist. Unlike American writers, for whom working on movies usually meant going to Hollywood and setting literature aside, such French writers as Cocteau, Jean-Paul Sartre, Andr� Malraux, Jean Giraudoux, and Jacques Pr�vert were active in the cinema without having to distance themselves, geographically or practically, from the literary scene. <p></p>Postwar Paris was teeming with movies, especially American movies. Having been deprived of Hollywood productions under the German occupation, moviegoers were hungry to see those that had been made during World War II as well as the latest ones, and they flooded the screens. These films too were taken seriously, and nowhere more so than in a magazine called La Revue du cin�ma, which was published by France&#x2019;s most prestigious literary publisher, Gallimard. When the fifteen-year-old Jean-Luc Godard came to Paris in 1946 to attend the prestigious Lyc�e Buffon, he entered a lively and burgeoning cinematic scene, one that was energized both by the quantity of films available and by the quality of thought in circulation regarding the "seventh art." It was enriched by contact with the literary, artistic, and intellectual elite that embraced it, and was riven by political controversies that mirrored the political divisions of postwar France&#x2014;some of which were aroused by the cinema itself. <p></p>GODARD WAS BORN ON DECEMBER 3, 1930, in the elegant seventh arrondissement of Paris. His father, Paul Godard, a doctor, moved the family to Switzerland four years later. His mother, Odile, n�e Monod, was the daughter of one of the most prominent bankers in France, Julien Monod, a founder of the Banque Paribas. Monod was also an extremely literate man, a close friend of the writer Paul Val�ry and, after Val�ry&#x2019;s death in 1945, his literary executor. <p></p>Family documents include a letter that Val�ry wrote to Odile Monod in April 1928, on the occasion of her engagement to Paul Godard. She was eighteen years old at the time; her fianc� was twenty-seven. Her parents opposed the marriage; Paul Godard, though Protestant like the Monods, was not of their social station. Nonetheless, the couple married in 1928. They settled temporarily in Paris, and their first child, Rachel, was born on January 1, 1930. (Val�ry&#x2019;s letter to the newborn, dated January 6, 1930, is published in the collection Lettres � quelques-uns.) Godard also has two younger siblings, a brother, Claude, born in 1933, and a sister, V�ronique, born in 1937. <p></p>The most comprehensive research on the subject of Godard&#x2019;s family and youth has been done by Colin MacCabe, who was, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Godard&#x2019;s authorized biographer; the results of his research were published in 2003, in his Portrait of the Artist at Seventy.4 Paul Godard worked at a private medical clinic, La Ligni�re, near Gland, on the shore of Lake Geneva, between Geneva and Lausanne, and ultimately opened a clinic of his own, near Lausanne. Broken plaster in a wall there was said in family lore to have been made by young Jean-Luc&#x2019;s head during a transport of rage. To see a photograph of the wall is to fear for any child whose head might have done it.5 His mother wrote of the toddler Godard&#x2019;s furious temper, calling him a grand �clabousseur (a great spatterer).6 <p></p>The family was prosperous and cultured. Reading aloud from literature was a common form of domestic entertainment and ritual. Godard&#x2019;s grandfather, Julien Monod, enforced humanistic rules, including the requirement that youngsters recite literature at the dinner table. Each year, on his maternal grandparents&#x2019; wedding anniversary, young Jean-Luc was expected to recite Val�ry&#x2019;s poem "Le Cimeti�re marin" (The Seaside Cemetery).7 (Moreover, Godard recalled receiving Latin lessons from Val�ry.) 8 Religion was part of the family&#x2019;s cultural heritage as well, and Godard recalled attending Protestant "temple" regularly though without doctrinaire devotion: he considered it a casual habit ("I went, the same way I played soccer or did gymnastics") 9 and, with his grandfather Monod, debated the minister&#x2019;s sermons. <p></p>When World War II started, nine-year-old Jean-Luc Godard was in Brittany on vacation with relatives, and it was only with some difficulty that he could return to Switzerland. Godard spent most of the war in Switzerland, though he and members of his family habitually crossed Lake Geneva in a small boat to make clandestine visits to their grandfather&#x2019;s estate on the French side of the lake. <p></p>During the war, Godard&#x2019;s parents worked with the Red Cross and, Godard came to believe, had knowledge of the concentration camps established by Nazi Germany. MacCabe emphasizes the pro-English sympathies of Paul Godard (who had studied in London and, during the war, sheltered an English prisoner of war), yet Godard often spoke instead of his father&#x2019;s pro-German sympathies, and, following his family&#x2019;s lead, he was rooting for the Germans. He followed the course of the war on a map, with pins representing the movement of the opposing armies as reported in newspapers; he cheered on the advances of the German army and lamented its reversals, and later recalled, "When Rommel lost at El Alamein, I was deeply affected, a little as if my favorite soccer team had lost a game." <p></p>Godard&#x2019;s maternal grandparents were supporters of Vichy. Godard later described his maternal grandfather as "anti-Jew" and an "anti-Semite," and remembered hearing Julien Monod refer to his doctor as a youpin (kike).10 At home, the family listened to Vichy-run radio, where Jean-Luc grew accustomed to the rhetoric of pro-German politicians and commentators and remembered, decades later, the rapt attention when speeches by Philippe Henriot were broadcast. The days of Henriot&#x2019;s assassination (in 1944) and of the execution of Robert Brasillach, the right-wing critic and novelist and anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi propagandist (in 1945), were days of mourning in the Godard house.11 <p></p>Godard recalled spending about a year and a half, from the ages of twelve and thirteen, in wartime Vichy, where his maternal grandfather "knew some people." Godard recalled that he always had an "affinity" for Julien Monod, whose sympathies were clearly suggested by the reading that he shared with his grandson Jean-Luc, as Godard later recalled: "I read Les D�combres, by Lucien Rebatet, because my grandfather was ultra-literary ...At night, we read aloud. We read Rebatet&#x2019;s novel."12 Rebatet, who was convicted of collaboration in 1946 and spent six years in prison, was a vehement anti-Semite and actively endorsed France&#x2019;s pro-Nazi regime. Les D�combres (The Ruins), his lengthy screed about the decline of France&#x2014;in his view, due largely to French Jewry and reversible by collaboration with Germany&#x2014;was said to be "for the little Parisian collaborationist world, the great politico-literary event of 1942." 13 <p></p>The young Godard was an eager reader; his preferred fare was the children&#x2019;s adventure novel, such as Le Voyage d&#x2019;Edgar, by Edouard Peisson, whose work was popular at the time. His mother was ...</p><h2>Plants vs. Zombies: Official Guide to Protecting Your Brains</h2><p><p><em>Plants vs. Zombies: The Official Guide to Protecting Your Brains</em> is a must for kids who love the video game <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>.</p><p>There are more than twenty-five types of zombies in the fantastical world of <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, and each has a special talent&#x2014;from pole-vaulting to digging to teaming up with a zombie dolphin.</p><p>Fortunately, a gamer armed with <em>The Official Guide to Protecting Your Brains</em> has all the tricks, knowledge, and strategy needed to plant a garden&#x2014;perhaps with a few Fume-shrooms, Cherry Bombs, and Potato Mines&#x2014;that will defeat each member of the fun-loving, brain-eating mob.

A true baseball original, McGraw, as Alexander describes, "ate gunpowder every morning and washed it down with raw blood." He loved to win, but he hated losing more, and as manager of both the old Baltimore Orioles and New York Giants, he's the only skipper in the game's history to win almost 1,000 games more than he lost. McGraw was so outsized, flamboyant, fiery, and, at times, sentimental, that it would be easy to caricature him; Alexander's remarkable achievement here is that he doesn't (nor does he succumb to hero worship or bubble bursting). His triumph is letting McGraw stand on his own two spikes; the man--and the legend--have no problem standing up for themselves. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>&#x201c;There has been only one manager&#x2014;and his name is McGraw.&#x201d;&#x2014;Connie Mack (Connie Mack)<br><br>&#x201c;Diligently researched and artfully written, John McGraw illuminates not only the man but the transformation of America and its national pastime between 1890 and 1930.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Absorbing. . . .

It initiates the reader into a deep, living relationship with God. Keating gives an overview of the history of contemplative prayer in the Christian tradition, and step-by-step guidance in the method of centering prayer. Special attention is paid to the role of the Sacred Word, Christian growth and transformation, and active prayer.</p><p>Invitation to Love: The Way of Christian Contemplation is the natural next step. In Open Mind, Open Heart, Father Keating presents the beginning of a process of spiritual growth. In this book, he outlines and explains the actual stages of this process, tackling questions such as: How will it affect my life? Where does it lead us spiritually? What obstacles will I encounter along the way? Why is it necessary? How does it work?</p><p>Also following upon Open Mind, Open Heart, presenting a profound formation in Christian prayer, Mystery of Christ demonstrates the contemplative dimension of Christian worship. Here Father Keating recovers the deeper sense of the liturgical year and shares a theological and mystical perspective on the major feasts of the annual cycle. The reader is immersed in the wonder of faith in the mystery of Christ and of the unique nature of God's action and presence in and through the liturgy of our lives.</p></p><p>Father Thomas Keating is known throughout the world as an exponent, teacher, and writer on contemplative prayer.

For the writer, there was something majestic and elemental about these inscrutable creatures, whose searing gaze could penetrate deep into our beings. Bukowski considered cats to be unique forces of nature, elusive emissaries of beauty and love.</p><p><em>On Cats</em> offers Bukowski's musings on these beloved animals and their toughness and resiliency. He honors them as fighters, hunters, survivors who command awe and respect as they grip tightly onto the world around them: "A cat is only ITSELF, representative of the strong forces of life that won't let go."</p><p>Funny and moving, Bukowski's <em>On Cats</em> brings together the acclaimed writer's reflections on these animals he so admired. Bukowski's cats are fierce and demanding&#x2014;he captures them stalking their prey; crawling across his typewritten pages; waking him up with claws across the face. But they are also affectionate and giving, sources of inspiration and gentle, insistent care.</p><p>Poignant yet free of treacle, <em>On Cats</em> is an illuminating portrait of this one-of-a-kind artist and his unique view of the world, witnessed through his relationship with the animals he considered among his most profound teachers.</p>Charles Bukowski is one of America&#39;s best-known contemporary writers of poetry and prose, and, many would claim, its most influential and imitated poet. He was born in 1920 in Andernach, Germany, to an American soldier father and a German mother, and brought to the United States at the age of three. He was raised in Los Angeles and lived there for fifty years. He published his first story in 1944 when he was twenty-four and began writing poetry at the age of thirty-five.

And what a story it is. Based on extensive conversations with the subject, 100 additional interviews, and various documents both public and private, business journalist Bertil Torekull employs an unusual mixture of blunt first-person recollections and narrative overviews delivered with literary flair to peel away the intricacies of Kamprad's life. Along the way, Torekull reveals the creative forces that propelled Kamprad's distinctive entrepreneurial drive and fashioned a successful company. "Imagine one of the coldest little countries in the world. Think of the most barren part of that country. See in front of you a godforsaken place deep in the wild spruce forests," Torekull begins. "This book is about a man who grew up in that harsh environment, which was to mark his whole life and fundamentally color the philosophy with which he built his vast empire." Delving into a fascinating career that began taking shape at the unlikely age of 5, Torekull presents this tale in a way that entertains as well as educates. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>Bertil Torekull is a journalist, the author of six books, and the founder of Sweden's top economic daily newspaper, <i>Dagens Industri.</i></p><h2>A School of Her Own (Grandma&#39;s Attic Series)</h2><p>Fresh out of school herself, eighteen-year-old Mabel takes a teaching job in a farming community similar to the one where she grew up.</p><p></p><h2>Serial Killers: Profiles of Today&#39;s most Terrifying Criminals(True Crime)</h2><p>Recounts the cases of Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Dennis Nilsen, and David Berkowitz, and briefly surveys earlier celebrated killers, including Jack the Ripper and the Boston Strangler</p><p></p><h2>Deep Black: Space Espionage and National Security</h2><p>Examines how space technology is being used for espionage, discusses the clashes between the Air Force and the CIA for control of the vast system, and details the rivalry between Washington and Moscow</p><p></p><h2>The Ten Commandments</h2><p>This beautiful keepsake edition of The Ten Commandments is illuminated with the paintings of Arthur Szyk, one of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest religious artists.

The victims ranged from an anonymous, well-to-do couple to an heiress to the pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski, Sharon Tate. Exhibiting an almost voyeuristic passion for his topic, King (The Duchess of Windsor, 1999) unearths a staggering trove of information on Tate, an actress who died at 26 with barely a handful of films and television appearances to her credit. Beyond limning Tate's short life, King takes readers into the midst of the Manson family, profiling her killers' pasts, the sex and drugs rites of the Manson family, and the career of Manson himself (the criminal and failed pop idol who was convicted of compelling them to murder). Making extensive use of seldom-seen material (including police and detective reports, photographs of the murder scene, Manson family-member parole trial transcripts, and interviews with principal and secondary characters like Tate's mother, Doris, and surviving relatives of other Manson family victims), King unflinchingly recreates the brutality and utter randomness of the events of early August 1969. Beyond the sensational reportage (including a harrowing and grisly, minute-by-minute account of the murders of Tate and the four others at 10050 Cielo Drive), King reveals the condition and whereabouts of Manson family members while including some lucid and trenchant observations on the continuing cult of Manson (e.g., the merchandising of Manson's image). King also details the victims'-rights advocacy work of Tate's mother and sister.Readers might wonder why King's account suddenly surfaces 31 years after the killings, but true-crime fans and Manson fetishists (you know who you are) will find it irresistible. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Veteran celebrity biographer King (The Duchess of Windsor, etc.) gives us a thorough account of Sharon Tate's brief life, her star-crossed career and her tragic death at the hands of Charles Manson's Family. King counters the grisly familiarity of the Tate-LaBianca murders by approaching the oft-told story from the perspective of Tate's innocent Hollywood ambitions, presenting her as representative of the 1960s-era woman in pursuit of L.A. stardom and liberation. He recounts her youth as a soldier's daughter in Italy, her struggles in films like Valley of the Dolls (which presented her as a nascent sex kitten) and her ominous relationship with the volatile, philandering Roman Polanski. King portrays Tate as an essentially simple, generous-hearted person who possessed an unfortunate na?vet? regarding the hidden social storms she traversed. But King's narrative gets less interesting as he begins to reconstruct the Family's development, its descent into the mad butchery of Tate, Leno LaBianca and others, and the arrests. Although King coherently re-creates the stale hippie dreams, criminal tensions and drug-tainted glamour of the cultural milieu in which Manson operated, he breaks little new ground, rehashing what is already known from prosecutor Bugliosi's seminal Helter Skelter. Albeit capably researched and written, this account in the end occupies that uneasy perch between veneration and exploitation. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beyond Bodybuilding: Muscle and Strength Training Secrets for the Renaissance Man</h2><p>Smash Your Training Plateaus, Overcome Injuries, Make Unprecedented Strength Gains and Grow More Muscle... with a Classical Education in the Wisdom of the Past and the Scientific Breakthroughs of the Modern Day Masters The fight for greater strength and muscle is the story of a constant struggle against conflicting forces... Since ancient times when strength meant survival to the more modern goals of competitive excellence and physical culture, we ve fought a never-ending battle with our own bodies to achieve and maintain maximum performance.

And that s mostly because we never got the education we needed to know how to win and keep winning the guerrilla war against our own bodies. Of course, it doesn t help, in this day and age, that we also have to fight the myth-mongering marketers of strength training half-truths, preying on our ignorance to make a quick buck out of the gullible... We have to fight against the machines, the gizmos, the quick fixes, the absurd claims and the downright foolishness of most of what passes for training advice in the magazines and gyms of our country.

Pavel has, frankly, done the research for you... plundering both the classic and the little-known strength texts from past and present... networking and comparing notes with many of today s great masters... submitting his own body to the pain of infinite experiment. And Pavel has trained thousands of troops and police whose life might depend on his tips... hundreds of athletes and martial artists with the chance to achieve their dreams thanks to his advice. And of course, tens of thousands have gone to the dragondoor.com strength forum to share the astonishing gains and results they have achieved by employing Pavel s strength advice...

In <em>The Last of His Kind</em>, <em>National Geographic Adventure</em> contributing editor David Roberts goes beyond conventional biography to reveal the essence of this man through the prism of his extraordinary exploits from New England to Chamonix, the Himalaya to the Yukon.</p><p>Washburn's remarkable achievements&#x2014;including nine first ascents of North American peaks&#x2014;would stamp him not only as one of a kind, but as one of a kind they don't make anymore. Born June 7, 1910, to a Boston Brahmin family whose roots trace back to the <em>Mayflower</em>, this highly intelligent, impatient, and stubborn iconoclast published books, made a monumental first ascent in the French Alps that would become a touchstone in mountaineering history, and lectured on his adventures&#x2014;including an address to the National Geographic Society&#x2014;while still in his teens. In 1935, at the age of twenty-four, while others were turning their attention to the Himalaya, the Harvard-educated Washburn led a three-month journey across what was then the largest remaining unexplored territory in North America&#x2014;the 6,400 square miles of glaciers and mountains in the frozen heart of Alaska's Saint Elias Range.</p><p>In addition to his prowess as a mountaineer and photographer, Washburn was also a renowned surveyor and cartographer, producing maps of little-known terrain&#x2014;the Grand Canyon, Mt. McKinley, and Mt. Everest&#x2014;that surpassed those that came before, and several of which remain the standard. He was also a scientist who would take a regional natural-history museum and transform it into one of the outstanding teaching institutions of its kind in the world.</p><p>Roberts introduces the family, teachers, friends, colleagues, and rivals who would play important roles in this legendary man's experiences, and re-creates his enthralling journeys to some of the most remote and beautifully wild places on earth. An exciting narrative of mountain climbing in the twentieth century, <em>The Last of His Kind</em> brings into focus Washburn's deeds in the context of the history of mountaineering, and provides a fascinating look at an amazing culture and the influential icon who shaped it.</p><p>David Roberts is an avid climber and the author of more than twenty books, including <em>The Mountain of My Fear</em>, which was named on <em>National Geographic Adventure</em>'s list of the 100 Greatest Adventure Books of All Time. His articles have appeared in <em>National Geographic Adventure</em>, <em>Men's Journal</em>, and <em>Smithsonian</em>, among other publications. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p></p><h2>Half Magic: Fiftieth-Anniversary Edition (Tales of Magic)</h2><p>Edward Eager's hilarious and heartwarming <i>Half Magic</i> has been working wizardry on young readers for fifty years. To celebrate the golden anniversary of this enduringly popular story, a deluxe edition of the book has been created. It features the original jacket, a ribbon marker, two-color printing, and a new introduction by Jack Gantos, the award-winning author of <i>Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key</i>.<br></p><p>Edward Eager has been delighting young readers for more than 40 years with stories that mix magic and reality. <i>Half Magic,</i> the most popular of his tales about four children who encounter magical coins, time-travel herb gardens, and other unlikely devices, is a warm, funny, original adventure. The "Half Magic" of the title refers to a coin that the children find. Through a comical series of coincidences, they discover that the coin is magic. Well, it's not <i>totally</i> magic--it's only (you guessed it) <i>half</i> magic. That means there's a certain logic to the wishes one must make to generate a desired outcome. Imagine the results emerging from inaccurate efforts: "half" invisible, "half" rescued, "half" everything! <p> <i>Half Magic</i> is never too cute, and with just enough emotion to complement the magic, this book is sure to hold a special place in any child's library. (The publisher suggests the book for kids ages 9-12, but it's fun enough to read aloud to those slightly younger and clever enough for kids who are a bit older.)</p>First published 1954<br>Previous hardcover edition 1999 0-15-202069-1<br>Previous paperback edition 1999 0-15-202068-3<br></p><h2>The Annotated Innocence of Father Brown</h2><p>Father Brown, an ordinary priest whose unremarkable exterior conceals extraordinary crime-solving ability, is celebrated for his solutions to metaphysical mysteries, a genre perfected by his creator, G. K. Chesterton. More than lighthearted comedies built around puzzling crimes, these superbly written tales contain deeply perceptive philosophical reflections. <br><i>The Innocence of Father Brown</i> (1911) was the first collection of stories featuring the ecclesiastical sleuth and is widely considered the best.

Included also are eight illustrations reproduced from the first edition. The result is an indispensable companion for all Chesterton enthusiasts and a perfect introduction for anyone who has yet to meet the incomparable Father Brown.</p><p>Widely known as the &#34;Prince of Paradox,&#34; G. K. Chesterton was one of the most influential English writers and thinkers of the 20th century. Chesterton&#39;s prodigious talents embraced a wide range of subjects, from philosophy and religion to detective fiction and fantasy. And while his writings are light and whimsical, they are filled with direct and honest truths.</p><h2>Calico Canyon</h2><p>Let yourself be swept away by this fast-paced romance, featuring Grace Calhoun, an instructor of reading, writing, and arithmetic, who, in an attempt to escape the clutchs of a relentless pursuer, runs smack dab into even more trouble with the 6R&#39;s - widower Daniel Reeves, along with his five rowdy sons.

Examples from his own experience and from community and business life are sprinkled with teachings from the world&#x2019;s religions -- not to mention a healthy dose of common sense. To the religious and nonobservant alike, <i>Taking Stock</i> reveals: </p> <p> </p> <p> * the role money plays in our lives </p> <p> * why we envy others for things we don&#x2019;t need </p> <p> * the difference between failure and failing </p> <p> * and how to ""start over"" using new definitions of success and happiness </p> <p> </p> <p> The book closes with Prescriptions for Each Day of the Week, each one an inspiring and beautiful story with a gentle, clear moral.

I had known it would be difficult, but I had no idea that it was going to be this hard. John had died in September, on the twenty-fifth in fact, so Christmas was three months to the day since his death. I tried hard not to feel sorry for myself but was only successful part of the time.<br>I learned to play bridge, bought tickets to the symphony, and enrolled in a weekly watercolor class. These things helped pass the time, it was true, but in many ways I felt like I was just going through the motions. I had dreaded the last day of November, knowing that when I tore off the calendar page on the thirtieth it would mean that Christmas was just around the corner, and it would be the first one in forty-six years without my beloved Johnny.<br><br>I heaved myself out of the La-Z-Boy with a deep sigh. No sense dwelling on it. I had to stop feeling sorry for myself. Thank the Lord, my daughter Wendy still lived in town, although she had been talking more and more about moving out east since her divorce from Dave. She felt there were more job opportunities in the advertising field out there. Wendy was a go-getter, all right. I could have predicted that she wouldn't stay in Swan River for long, even if her marriage to Dave had worked out. Well, she was here in town for the time being anyway, and at least we'd have each other's company for Christmas dinner.<br><br>With that thought in mind, I propelled myself toward the kitchen where the turkey lolled nakedly in the roaster, ready for stuffing. I'd make the stuffing, peel the potatoes, and start on the pie crust. Wendy was making candied yams and some new recipe for blood pudding, of all things! John would have hated it. Truth to tell, so would I. But, sweet man that he was, John would have eaten it anyway, grinning all the while so as not to hurt Wendy's feelings. Such a kind heart. A prince among men. Oh, how I missed him!<br><br>A shrill ring startled me from my melancholy reverie. Quickly, I wiped my hands on my apron and reached for the phone. It was Wendy.<br>'Hi, Mom,' my daughter said breathlessly. 'I'm on the run here, so I won't keep you. I just want to know whether you'd mind it terribly if we had a couple of guests&#x2014;some friends of mine. I know it's short notice, but you always cook enough for an army anyway, and I know you'll enjoy meeting them. So, how about it? Is it okay?'<br><br>I suddenly felt so tired. I really didn't want to entertain strangers. Just getting through the day was a monumental effort by itself. Reluctantly, I agreed, but Wendy, a sensitive girl from the time she was a child, knew that I didn't mean it. Despite that fact, Wendy rolled along enthusiastically.<br>'Great then, Mom. I'll pick them up on my way over. See you at six o'clock.'<br><br>The line went dead before I could ask my daughter exactly who she was bringing, much less say good-bye. Well, it didn't much matter, I supposed. I would put on a brave face and soldier through it.<br><br>The rest of the day flew by, it seemed. There was so much for me to do, what with the cooking, the baking, arranging the centerpiece, and getting the table set. Then I still had myself to get ready&#x2014;no small task these days. Wendy was always telling me that I was still an attractive woman, and that any man would be thrilled to be seen in my company. She was such a flatterer, that one. No wonder she was successful in advertising!<br><br>The doorbell chimed at precisely six o'clock. I could always count on Wendy's being on time. She had gotten that from her father. John hated being late for anything. Putting on a wide smile, I bustled to the door and opened it to my company. Wendy appeared to be alone. Puzzled, I peered out into the clear, wintry night but could not see anyone else on the porch. Suddenly, I heard giggling, and then in the next instant, I felt two sets of woolly arms around me, familiar and comforting.<br><br>'How are ya' doing, Clairey-Clairey-quite contrary?' one voice trilled. 'Good to see ya, luv.'<br>'Give us a kiss then, ey? Show us you're glad to see us,' the other one boomed.<br><br>My throat tightened; I felt the tears well up, then spill hotly down my cheeks. I was speechless. Joy and disbelief flooded through me simultaneously. Teddy and Mary-Rose were throwing their suitcases into the front hall in a noisy jumble, both speaking to me at the same time and tugging on my sleeve as they vied for my attention, just as they had when they were children. In a boisterous hodgepodge, Wendy squeezed her aunt and uncle through the narrow entryway, picking up the suitcases, and setting them aside out of the way. Her beaming face, flushed from the cold, creased in a radiant smile.<br><br>'All the way from England, and not so much as a 'how d'ya do'!' Teddy teased. 'What do you think we should do, Mary-Rose? Maybe we should just turn around and get the next plane for Manchester, ey?'<br><br>At last, I found my voice. I had last seen my brother and sister, fraternal twins four years my junior, when I'd gone back home to bury our dear mother. That was thirteen years ago. Of course, they had written, and there was the occasional long-distance phone call, but it was not the same as seeing them. Then, when John had died, they had sent a long, heartfelt telegram and apologized that they could not be with me. Despite my disappointment, I had understood. Manchester was far away; they had their jobs and their families, after all, and it would have cost the Earth to get to Swan River on time for the funeral. And now, incredibly, here they were. Thank the Lord, here they were! With my eyes brimming over, I untangled myself from my siblings' arms and moved over to Wendy, who was standing quietly near the staircase that led upstairs, watching the happy reunion unfolding in front of her.<br><br>'Wendy, dear girl of mine, did you orchestrate all of this?' I whispered.<br>'No big deal, Mom,' Wendy replied.<br>'Oh, my sweet girl, it's a very, very big deal, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Now, did you bring along that delicious blood pudding you said you were going to prepare? I can't wait to try it. I'll bet your dad would have loved it!' <p></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> <p>Sharon Melnicer</p><br><br> <p><strong>Connecting at Christmas</strong></p><br> <p>Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love.<br>Hamilton Wright Mabie</p><br>In a frosty December morning, I talked with my girls, Lynsey and Laura, about God's gift to us in Jesus. I reminded them how God gave us an undeserved gift, the hope offered to us through the birth of Christ. The pure love of our Heavenly Father who gave, without condition, continued to amaze me.<br>'Then,' I challenged, 'how could we not respond to him who loves us so?' I suggested doing a special family project to underscore the message of Christmas. Even though they were children, I urged them to think about selfless giving with no expectation to receive. 'God uses servants of all ages,' I said.<br>&nbsp; Lynsey, then fifteen, popped up with, 'We can make a gift basket for one of the old people at church!' Living with a teen had taught me to seize and rally around any act of outward thoughtfulness, so I encouraged her idea.<br><br>&nbsp; Nine-year-old Laura chimed in, 'Yeah, we can put stuff together and give it to 'em for Christmas.' We all agreed that a surprise gift basket would be our family project.<br><br>'Now, who'll be our recipient?' I asked. Laura suggested several names of senior citizens at church. After much discussion, we settled on 'Mr. Paul.'<br>&nbsp; Paul, known in our home as 'Mr. Paul,' was a cheerful, kind, rotund gent. He and his wife had a long, loving marriage, but no children. In fact, except for his wife, Mr. Paul had no living family. Each Sunday, Mr. Paul and his wife faithfully worked in the church's sound booth recording services for the homebound. They felt it was their ministry. They also felt it was their ministry to 'hush' the children chattering in the hall. Often, they were the eyes and ears of absent parents.<br>&nbsp; But early that year, Mr. Paul's wife had received a diagnosis of terminal cancer. Within months, his world changed as he buried his wife and partner of fifty years. We knew it'd be a particularly lonely Christmas for Mr. Paul.<br><br>&nbsp; Parties,...</p><h2>The Damnation Game</h2><p>In a nightworld where decomposing corpse-assassins stalk their prey, Marty Strauss, the bodyguard to a famous industrialist, discovers that someone is coming to collect the soul of his employer as payment for an ancient debt. Reissue.</p><p>Born in Liverpool in 1952, Clive Barker writes, directs and produces for the screen. His films include Hellraiser and Nightbreed."I have seen the future of the horror genre, and his name is Clive Barker," Stephen King has written. Fortunately, this first novel (Barker has published short story collections) more than bears the weight of King's praise. Barker is a better writer than King, and his characters are just as interesting. Set in modern Britain, the story thrusts a flawed "innocent"parolee Marty Straussinto an epic conflict between wealthy Joseph Whitehead and Mamoulian the Cardplayer, a centuries-old creature with whom Whitehead had struck a bargain to obtain his wealth and power. Whitehead reneges, and the resulting struggle is played out primarily on his fortress-like estate. Barker's excellent writing makes the graphic, grotesque imagery endemic to current horror fiction very effective. Highly recommended anywhere horror fiction is popular. A.J.

She immediately raised her palm to shield her eyes; the piercing light was too strong.<br><br>Inside, her house was quiet and dark. Bronte and Finney were asleep in their rooms, the dog was whining, and she hadn't yet had a cup of coffee. Tom was prowling the rooms with nervous energy, gathering his work and packing last-minute items into his suitcase. Most mornings Eve liked to linger over her coffee, open the windows to the fresh morning breezes and relish her few moments of solitude before the family's demands pressed her into action. On this morning, Eve felt driven outdoors by her husband's prickly tension and a nagging guilt she resented. She needed some distance, just a bit of fresh air.<br><br>Eve remembered the days when she stayed one step behind Tom as he prepared to go on a business trip. "Here are your tickets. I found your beeper. Can I order you a cab? Don't you want anything for breakfast? Let me refresh your coffee." She was his trusty sidekick, or as Tom often put it, he was the captain and she the navigator.<br><br>Lately, however, she felt the ship was going down. For no one reason she could articulate, she'd begun looking for lifeboats. It wasn't so much that she doubted the competence of Tom, it was just that the buttons of his jacket didn't shine quite as bright anymore. Or perhaps the voyage was just too long.<br><br>Eve shook these mutinous thoughts out of her mind and stepped out into the morning air. "Today will be a good day," she said firmly, silencing her heart murmuring, "He will <em>not</em> ruin my day." She made her way toward the rustling breezes and birdsong in her garden, turning away from the closed, dark house. The early-morning air smelled sweet and the sun shone softly on the cheery colors of her perennial bed. She bent to admire droplets of dew cupped in the furry leaf of a lady's mantle.<br><br>Today was the first day of summer, she realized, her spirits lifting like a kite. She loved milestones of any sort: birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, checks on the calendar, notches on a growth chart. Today would be special, brand-new. She felt it deep inside. Summer was here with sunny days and balmy nights, the informality of barbecues and dips in the swimming pool. She was so relieved to have the grind of the school year finished. She missed playing with her children.<br><br>She really should wake them to say goodbye to their father, but they were so tired; she'd let them sleep a bit longer. Finney had a football game at noon and Bronte wanted a ride to the mall at two. With Tom gone for a few days, and the children out of school, she could relax a bit herself. Perhaps even squeeze in a little extra time in her garden this morning, she thought, noting that her tobacco plants needed deadheading.<br><br>She slipped to her knees, relishing the coolness of the morning dew that soaked the thin cotton of her pajamas. She no longer expected anyone to help her with the weeding or the planting. The children had complained so bitterly for so many years that she'd stopped demanding their time, and Tom, well, he never had the time or the interest. They had such busy lives and it was her job, as the mother and wife, to make certain all went smoothly in the home. But it was such a large home...and theirs was a large property, too, one of the largest in Riverton. The children were proud of their home and this she felt was her success. She'd decorated the twelve rooms herself, sewn countless yards of drapes and coordinated all the improvements. She'd even landscaped the entire lot, planting with her own delicate hands over fifty shrubs and countless perennials.<br><br>Gardening was her hobby after all, she told herself as she dug in the earth. No one asked her to plant these flowers that she adored. So why should she expect them to help? And wasn't it the mother's job, even duty, to make a home run smoothly? Wasn't she indispensable? Still, the thought that no one offered to help rankled as she reached to pull out the offending weeds, careful to get the roots.<br><br>The front door swung open and she lifted her gaze to see her husband hurry down the stone steps on his way to the garage. His coattails were flying, he was tripping over his luggage and he sent off sparks of irritation that she could feel clear across the garden. Though his dark suit was immaculate, his white shirt was gleaming and his tie had enough panache to be discreetly admired, her knowing eyes picked up the tight line of his lips that gave his chiseled, tanned face a tautness too familiar of late. Tom wasn't a vain man. His hair might be thinning at the crown and his waist fuller, but Tom Porter still had movie-star good looks&#x2014;looks that would have been a hindrance to his medical career except for the sharp intelligence and compassion in his dark eyes.<br><br>Eve didn't see his eyes this morning, however, because the light was too bright. She squinted and caught only the shadow of his passing.<br><br>"I'll phone you tonight," he called over his shoulder with a distracted air.<br><br>She didn't reply and instead rested her hands on her thighs and watched him raise the trunk of his sedan, then toss in his new garment bag. Next he gingerly rested his computer bag beside it. Eve knew exactly what was in that overnight bag she'd purchased for him for his fiftieth birthday. She'd laid in bed last night with her hands clenched in her lap silently watching as he packed it. The memory still irked.<br><br>"Why do you always wait until the last minute to pack?" she'd asked crossly. "It's almost midnight, Tom. I'm tired and we have to get up early. Your plane leaves at seven so you'll have to leave by six."<br><br>"I didn't have time to do it any earlier." His tone was sharp and he tossed a folded boxed shirt into the bag with an angry flip.<br><br>Eve bit her tongue, knowing this was true. She didn't wish to annoy him when he was so pressed for time. Still, she couldn't help the frustration boiling inside her. It didn't seem to concern him in the least that she would be kept awake for as long as it took him to pack.<br><br>"Why didn't you ask me to help? All I needed was your schedule. I'd have been happy to do it for you."<br><br>"I told you I was leaving."<br><br>"Yes," she replied in a tone that implied <em>How can you be so obtuse?</em> "But I didn't know to where, or for what, until yesterday."<br><br>She used to always know where he was going, what topic he was speaking on, and made a game of packing for him. They'd laughed when she held ties up to his face and test-kissed him to make her selection. She took such pride in his appearance, as she did in her children's. Recently, however, the trips piled one on top of the other as his reputation grew. He'd sometimes forget to tell her when he was going out of town until he needed something, and then he'd inform her as an afterthought. Like yesterday's <em>"Oh, Eve, could you make sure I have enough shirts for San Diego?"</em> Whether she'd lost track of his schedule or he'd stopped sharing it with her, she couldn't remember anymore. All she knew was that somehow, she no longer packed for him. So she lay in bed, still and hard-limbed, watching.<br><br>"Look, just let me get it done," he said, rummaging through his closet, laying her aside. "Go on to sleep. I'll be a while yet."<br><br>She heard his dismissal, closed her mouth and folded her arms across her chest. In a cool silence that had grown over the past years, she watched him pack for the two-day trip, knowing exactly how he reasoned his choices. Three pairs of underwear, two fresh and an extra to change into should he go for a swim, two pairs of dark, cashmere wool socks and a spare polo shirt. He selected three Egyptian cotton shirts and a matching Hermes tie, a swimsuit, a flask of Scotch because he liked to work late in his room and, finally, the leather toiletries case. She'd meant to ask him why he still carried condoms in his bag now that she'd had her tubes tied, but never did.<br><br>She knew he wasn't fooling around and didn't want him to think that she didn't trust him. They'd been married for twenty-three years next month and a woman knew her husband well enough after all that time. She and Tom had an agreement, one forged on their wedding night and held sacred. They'd sworn that neither one of them would have an affair without first telling the other. Divorce or whatever might follow, but they'd vowed to have honor and respect in their marriage. They prided themselves on their honesty.<br><br>Kneeling in the garden with the sun's heat pressing on her back, Eve envisioned those condoms in that toiletry bag and her bare hands dug into the black soil as she forced out a deep dandelion root. A large worm clung to the soil around the weed, wriggling and coiling when she shook it off. She heard the car trunk slam shut and raised her eyes again.<br><br>"Honey, what hotel will you be at?" she called out.<br><br>"Oh, I don't remember."<br><br>He sounded winded and she cocked her head, her hands still in the soil. He stood looking at her with an odd expression on his face, as though he were waiting for her to say something more, or perhaps he was wrestling with what to say to her. Her breath stilled and her attention focused as she studied him for some signal, one hint that he wanted a kiss goodbye or a familiar pat on the rear as he hugged her. He used to love to hug her.<br><br>A new stubbornness kept her from leaping up and running into his arms as she always had before, a tenuous clinging to self-esteem after his rebuff in bed last night. She would not go to him first.<br><br>Keeping her silence, staying in place, she noticed his hair was damp with perspiration. He was a heavy sweater&#x2014;all the Porters were&#x2014;but it wasn't that hot this morning and he'd just come outdoors from the air-conditioning. He'd need a shower by the time he got to San Diego, she worried.<br><br>"I'll call you when I get there," he said, and her ears perked at the hint of sadness in his voice. "Give you my room number."<br><br>This was the usual modus operandi these days, unlike back when she carefully posted the hotel name and number on the kitchen bulletin board, up high beside the car pool schedule, the pizza lunch schedule and emergency telephone number. She nodded and opened her mouth to say goodbye, to wish him a good trip, maybe to say I love you, but he'd already turned his back.<br><br>She bent over her garden and dug her small, oval nails into the soil, squeezing it between her fingers. Her eyes swam in water, and through the white noise of pain in her ears, she heard the car door slam, the roar of an engine and the grind of tires along dry cement. When the sound of his car disappeared, she felt a tremendous sense of loss. They couldn't continue on like this, she thought, sniffing loudly. When he came home they'd have a long talk, maybe go out to dinner. Wiping her eyes with her elbow, she methodically tugged out scores of the tiny invasive clovers, ripping them out one by one, quick and neat.<br><br>By six o'clock that evening Tom was long out of her thoughts. Her day was busy and she didn't have time to dwell. In truth, Tom was gone so much of the time lately that she'd learned to cope without him. She was chief cook and bottle washer around here. The children depended on her. She knew she was the axis upon which their worlds spun. On this first day of summer, Finney had won the football game for his team with a score in the last quarter and Bronte had come home with a triumphant smile and bags of clothes she'd bought on sale at Nordstrom's with her birthday money. Eve wiped her hands at the sink, feeling especially pleased with herself because, despite all the chauffeuring, she'd found time to shop at the farmer's market and bake an angel food cake to serve with the fresh berries. She'd surprise the children and serve it with a cheery, "Happy first day of summer!"<br><br>"Children, dinner!" she called up the stairs. After hearing their mumbled replies from behind closed bedroom doors, she hurried out the door to her garden to pluck a few flowers for the table. So early in the season, it was slim pickings. Many of the flowers were just gaining ground. She stood with her chin in her palm, considering the selection.<br><br>"Mom! Telephone!" Finney's voice cracked on the final syllable.<br><br>She smiled, then checked her watch. "Is it a solicitation?" She couldn't abide those pesty calls at the dinner hour. She snipped off one rose, then two more, careful of the slant. After a moment, she heard Finney again.<br><br>"Mom! She says it's important."<br><br>Irritation tightened her lips. These telephone solicitors were getting so cagey. "Well, who is it?"<br><br>"She says she's from San...San...something hospital."<br><br>Eve felt a chill and a cloud passed overhead. For a moment, time seemed to stand still. As though she were a remote stranger looking through a lens, she turned her head and saw her world, sharpening the focus. She saw her lovely redbrick Prairie-style house with its imposing porte cochere lined in front by broad-leafed rhododendron, the shadow of her fourteen-year-old daughter in the windows on her way to the dining room for dinner with a telephone to her ear, her lanky twelve-year-old son leaning against the frame of the open front door awaiting her instructions with the impatience of youth. This was her perfect world and instinctively she knew she'd better take a good last look.<br><br>Her breath exhaled in a prayer. "You're just being ridiculous," she told herself. She had such a flair for the dramatic. Tom was on grand rounds at San Diego Hospital. It was a message from him. What was the matter with her lately?<br><br>"Tell them I'm coming!" she called to Finney. She gathered the roses, then ran up the front steps, surprised at how wobbly her knees felt. She ignored Finney's darkened gaze and went straight to the phone lying on the kitchen counter.<br><br>"Hello," she managed to get out through dry lips. "This is Mrs. Porter."<br><br>"Hello, Mrs. Porter," came the soft, even tones of the faceless woman. "This is Dr. Raphaelson at San Diego Medical Center."<br><br>"Yes, what can I do for you?"<br><br>"Are you married to a Dr. Thomas Porter? From River-ton, Illinois?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br></p><h2>Tessa and Scott: Our Journey from Childhood Dream to Gold</h2><p><i>Tessa and Scott</i> tracks the pair's first meeting at the ages of seven and nine; their early competitions at the World Junior Championship and World Championships; and their incredible, history-making gold-medal performance at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, which established them as icons of ice dancing.

But was he? Some scholars deny that he existed at all. Did he? This challenging book examines the textual and archaeological evidence critically in an effort to paint an accurate picture of one of the Bible's central figures. <p>A leading scholar of biblical history and the ancient Near East, Baruch Halpern traces the development of the David tradition, showing how the image of David grew over time. According to Halpern, David was the founder of the dynasty that progressively exaggerated his accomplishments. Halpern's clear portrait of the historical David reveals his true humanity and shows him to be above all a politician who operated in a rough-and-tumble environment in which competitors were ready literally to slit throats. </p><p>David's Secret Demons explores a number of provocative questions: </p><p>Did King David actually exist? <br> Was David an Israelite or a Philistine?<br> Was Solomon really David's son? <br> Did David take the throne of Israel by the consent of the people?<br> How many murders did he commit on his way to the throne? <br> Are the biblical texts about David reliable? </p><p>Challenging, well argued, and written with accessible, at times humorous prose, David's Secret Demons will provoke discussion by scholars and general readers alike.</p></p><p>In a dazzling display of erudition, Halpern, chairman of Jewish studies at Pennsylvania State University, dissects the story of David with sparkling, witty prose, using historical, textual, psychological and archaeological analysis. Brandishing his broad knowledge, Halpern mentions Shakespeare, Agatha Christie, Mark Twain, Gregory Peck, Richard Gere, Bill Cosby, Joseph Heller, Disraeli and Hannibal Lecter, among others. He comments critically on the biblical narrative found in 1 and 2 Samuel and the second chapter of 1 Kings, asserting that it is contradictory, exaggerated and riddled with omissions. Conventional perceptions of David fault him for his affair with Bathsheba and for arranging the death of her husband, but generally portray him as a handsome, brave shepherd who became king and established Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Halpern elaborates and exploits the story of Bathsheba to paint David as a villain. He methodically demolishes any positive image of David, calling him a serial killer, thug, mercenary, adulterer, assassin, bandit, brigand and predator. Many sources are given to support these allegations but, surprisingly, Halpern fails to cite Robert Alter's excellent The David Story, which contains a full-blooded portrait of the Machiavellian king. While Halpern's picture of David is largely negative, he presents him as a complex biblical character who was "the first human being in world literature" but "not someone whom it would be wise to invite to dinner." Although Halpern forfeits accessibility by using such words as topos, paronomastically, circumvallations, therapon, epanalepsis, merismus, adyton and imbrication, this is an outstanding study. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Halpern (Jewish studies, Pennsylvania State Univ.) has given us a scholarly, fascinating, and controversial study of the figure of David in the Hebrew Scriptures. He does not doubt the actual existence of a historical figure named David, as does Thomas Thompson in his Early History of the Israelite People (Brill, 2001). However, he argues that the historical David was a far different person than the one pictured in 1 and 2 Second Samuel. The controversial nature of this study can be seen in the title of one of the chapters: "King David, Serial Killer." Halpern presents a close textual analysis of the stories about David in 1 Samuel 8 through 2 Samuel 1, along with a special study of 2 Samuel 8. He builds his case around the idea that there were two sources, identified here as A and B, which were used for the final versions of 1 and 2 Samuel. While Source A shows some of his faults, Source B is a kind of whitewashing apology for David in order to justify the kingship of Solomon and his successors. The real David, Halpern thinks, was a ruthless individual who was willing to murder or have murdered all of Saul's family so that he could secure the throne. Sure to receive much scholarly attention, Halpern's work can be profitably read by lay persons and scholars alike. Recommended for both public and academic libraries.

In this groundbreaking book, she documents this phenomenon, profiling fifteen remarkable women ranging in age from twenty-one to seventy whose lives and professions center on the outdoors. Some are field scientists or hold technical jobs--a zoologist, a speleologist (cave explorer), a builder of log houses--others have forged unique, self-reliant lifestyles in wilderness homesteads. These women, LaBastille herself among them, constitute a new and important category of role models for young women.<br>LaBastille also looks at the complex web of social and psychosexual factors that have alienated women from wilderness in the past and shows how feminism and the rise of environmental consciousness have allowed the "wilderness within women" to emerge. Updated with a new Afterword for this edition, Women and Wilderness offers exciting career ideas and inspiration for women everywhere.<br></p><p>ss, as a living and working environment, is still a frontier for women.

He lives in the Hudson Valley of New York State with his family.Gurney's bestselling illustrated fantasy, Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time, conjured up a lost world where people and dinosaurs live in peaceful interdependence. This sequel, which should be equally popular, follows the further adventures of naturalist Arthur Denison and his daredevil son, Will, shipwrecked on Dinotopia since 1862. Accompanied by exotic-looking musician Oriana Nascava and treacherous buccaneer Lee Crabb, father and son ride a submarine and stumble upon the World Beneath, a realm of quaint villages, labyrinthine tunnels, archetypal designs, natural stone sculptures, crystalline caves and lush gardens. The dinosaurs, whether above or below land, are sometimes fierce but more often genial presences who serve as means of transport and attend meetings with human elders. A treasure-hunting search for the fabled sunken city of Poseidos turns up connections among the Dinotopians, ancient Egypt and Atlantis. Despite the cardboard characters and trite story line, the more than 160 sparkling, fey paintings, at once fanciful and precise, pull readers into an enchanting adventure that should capture the most skeptical, armor-plated heart. 200,000 first printing; major ad/promo; Literary Guild, Scholastic and Doubleday Book Club selections; author tour. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Flavors of Puglia</h2><p>Dazzling combinations of colorful, earthy vegetables.&nbsp;&nbsp;Comforting soups with beans, grains, and fragrant herbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple seafood dishes prepared with fish and shellfish straight from the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasta adorned with fresh, flavorful sauces.&nbsp;&nbsp;Food that embraces the humble abundance of Puglia, from olive groves, wheatfields, vineyards, gardens, and the blue waters of the Adriatic and Ionian Seas.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this first-ever cookbook devoted to the foods of this bountiful region, located at the heel of the Italian boot, Nancy Harmon Jenkins combines her masterful knowledge of the Mediterranean with the recipes and traditions of Pugliese home cooks.<br><br>Featuring more than 100 recipes, for every course from the antipasti to dessert, <i>Flavors of Puglia</i> introduces American home cooks to the aromas and flavors of the cuisine of Puglia.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a culinary tour of this remarkable region, Jenkins offers recipes for classic Pugliese dishes including <i>tiedda,</i> a casserole made with mussels, potatoes, tomatoes, and zucchini; and <i>orecchiette,</i> Puglia's famous ear-shaped pasta, tossed with pungent broccoli rabe and dressed with a sprightly mix of oil, garlic, and red pepper.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other recipes include <i>panzerotti,</i> deep-fried tarts filled with onion-olive stuffing or a spicy pork filling; stewed black olives served with chunks of country-style bread for sopping up herb-scented olive oil; <i>calzone,</i> a two-crusted pizza with olives, leeks, and a hint of anchovy; and fresh fish and shellfish served on their own, in casseroles, or seafood stews.<br><br>Jenkins offers graceful descriptions of Puglia's landscape and introduces readers to local fishermen, bakers, pastamakers, olive oil producers, and winemakers who produce the best food the region has to offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;A detailed section for travelers offers restaurant and hotel suggestions and provides a list of dishes and food products that are specialties of the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;A resource guide and extensive notes on choosing ingredients round out this splendid cookbook, which will win readers over to this charming and, as yet, undiscovered region of Italy.</p><p>The realization that Italy is shaped like a boot is about as old a notion as footwear itself. But how often is the heel of that boot, the region called Puglia, ever considered? Rarely, to be sure. It's not just the glorious, far-reaching history of Puglia that begs to be explored, but also the living culture <i>and</i> the living foods. Nancy Harmon Jenkins, author of the <i>Mediterranean Diet Cookbook</i>, has at least taken on the food of Puglia, and through that portal we catch glimpses of the country's people, culture, and history. For Jenkins is no mere cookbook author, and <i>Flavors of Puglia</i> is no bottomless sump of recipes cast willy-nilly upon the page. She brings a keen intellect to her work as well as a passion for food, people, and the connections that can be made at a well-laid table--connections unlike any others. She is an anthropologist of the human soul as revealed through food, and the recipes she selects push the reader into a much deeper understanding of the soul of Puglia than would otherwise be possible. And the bonus? The sheer simplicity and deliciousness of it all. <p> "The cuisine of Puglia was shaped by the cuisine of poverty," Jenkins reports. But the region is unusual for the way the poor and the wealthy eat the same dishes, the same foods; "the rich simply eat more," as Jenkins says. So the point of the food is to take a few ingredients--never a lot of meat--and maximize the flavors. The results, both heavenly and healthy, turn the cook back to the origins of good food and diet. Jenkins's great trick is that she can make you smell the dish prepared on the page and even see the ocean change color as the sun fades and night embraces the land.</p>"Puglia, home of my paternal grandparents, has always held a special place in my heart. With the opening paragraphs of Nancy Harmon Jenkins' introduction, I felt myself falling yet again under the spell of Puglia's charm. Nancy's painstaking research and delicious, authentic recipes have created a Puglia-primer for all of us to enjoy."<br>--Michael Romano, Union Square Caf�, New York<p>"Nancy Harmon Jenkins opens the windows onto a culinary world that's new to most of us--the kitchens and countryside of Puglia.

After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in English and Creative Writing, she moved to New York City, where she worked in magazine publishing and marketing for nine years. <em>The Help</em> is her first novel.</strong></p> <p><strong> Kathryn Stockett:</strong> This is by far your most epic novel to date. How long did it take you to write <em>The Shoemaker&#x2019;s Wife</em>?</p> <p><strong> Adriana Trigiani:</strong> I worked on this story for over 20 years as I wrote scripts and novels and had my own family. There are scraps of paper, dinner napkins, and bills with timelines and notes scrawled across them. There are old notebooks filled with my grandmother&#x2019;s musings from 1985. I collected train tickets, copies of ships&#x2019; manifests, and a silk tag with my grandmother&#x2019;s name from garments she had created. I traveled as far as the Italian Alps and as close as the few blocks it takes me to walk to Little Italy in New York City to capture the historical aspects of the story. All of this went into the novel. It was a delicious gestation period.</p> <p><strong>Stockett:</strong> This is a novel, but it is inspired by a true story&#x2014;a family story, right?</p> <p><strong>Trigiani:</strong> Yes&#x2014;my grandparents, Lucia and Carlo. Their love was a dance with fate. It is riddled with near misses against a landscape of such massive world events that it&#x2019;s a wonder they got together at <em>all</em>. My challenge was to present their world to the reader so it might feel it was happening in the moment. I wanted the reader to have the experience I had when stories were told to me by the woman who lived them.</p> <p><strong>Stockett:</strong> The novel takes place during the first half of the twentieth century--what is so compelling about this period of time to you?</p> <p><strong>Trigiani:</strong> The cusp of the twentieth century was a time everything was new&#x2014;cars, phones, planes, electricity, even sportswear, and in each innovation was a kind of explosive potential. No one could predict where all the inventions would lead, people only knew that change was unavoidable.</p> <p>My grandparents were delighted every time America presented them with something they had never seen before. And my grandparents&#x2019; sense of wonder never left them, so I tried not to let it leave the page, be it a cross-country train ride or the first snap of the bobbin on an electric Singer sewing machine.</p> <p><strong>Stockett:</strong> Through the remarkable story of Enza and Ciro, your novel tells the larger story of the immigrant experience in America.</p> <p><strong>Trigiani:</strong> What a gift immigrants were and are to this country! They bring their talents and loyalty and make our country even greater. My grandparents were proud to be new Americans. Assimilation was not about copying an American ideal, but aspiring to their own version of it. The highest compliment you could pay a fellow immigrant was: he (or she) was a <em>hard worker</em>. I hear the phrase <em>work like an immigrant</em> said, but really, it&#x2019;s bigger than that&#x2014;we must also <em>dream like immigrants</em>.</p> <p><strong>Stockett:</strong> <em>The Shoemaker&#x2019;s Wife</em> seamlessly brings together fictional characters and historical figures&#x2014;how did the wonderful Caruso enter the novel?</p> <p><strong>Trigiani:</strong> It started with a three-foot stack of vinyl records&#x2014;my grandmother Lucia&#x2019;s collection of Caruso. Her absolute devotion to The Great Voice lasted her whole life long. I knew, in order to write this novel, I had to fall in love with Caruso too, because he sang the score of my grandparents&#x2019; love affair.</p> <p>When Lucia passed, I went to my first opera, seeking understanding and comfort. As the music washed over me, I began to understand why my grandmother was such a fan. The words were Italian, and the emotions were big; nothing was left unexpressed in the music. If only life were that way.</p><p>The majestic and haunting beauty of the Italian Alps is the setting of the first meeting of Enza, a practical beauty, and Ciro, a strapping mountain boy, who meet as teenagers, despite growing up in villages just a few miles apart. At the turn of the last century, when Ciro catches the local priest in a scandal, he is banished from his village and sent to hide in America as an apprentice to a shoemaker in Little Italy. Without explanation, he leaves a bereft Enza behind. Soon, Enza's family faces disaster and she, too, is forced to go to America with her father to secure their future.</p><p>Unbeknownst to one another, they both build fledgling lives in America, Ciro masters shoemaking and Enza takes a factory job in Hoboken until fate intervenes and reunites them. But it is too late: Ciro has volunteered to serve in World War I and Enza, determined to forge a life without him, begins her impressive career as a seamstress at the Metropolitan Opera House that will sweep her into the glamorous salons of Manhattan and into the life of the international singing sensation, Enrico Caruso. </p><p>From the stately mansions of Carnegie Hill, to the cobblestone streets of Little Italy, over the perilous cliffs of northern Italy, to the white-capped lakes of northern Minnesota, these star-crossed lovers meet and separate, until, finally, the power of their love changes both of their lives forever. </p><p>Lush and evocative, told in tantalizing detail and enriched with lovable, unforgettable characters, <em>The Shoemaker's Wife</em> is a portrait of the times, the places and the people who defined the immigrant experience, claiming their portion of the American dream with ambition and resolve, cutting it to fit their needs like the finest Italian silk.</p><p>This riveting historical epic of love and family, war and loss, risk and destiny is the novel Adriana Trigiani was born to write, one inspired by her own family history and the love of tradition that has propelled her body of bestselling novels to international acclaim. Like <em>Lucia, Lucia</em>, <em>The Shoemaker's Wife</em> defines an era with clarity and splendor, with operatic scope and a vivid cast of characters who will live on in the imaginations of readers for years to come.</p></p><h2>Arthur and the Golden Rope: Brownstone s Mythical Collection</h2><p>Imagine a vault so cavernous that it could contain all the world&#39;s greatest treasures and relics, from mummified remains of ancient monarchs to glistening swords brandished by legendary warriors.

Warshawski Novels)</h2><p>Among the first, and perhaps the most compelling, female private investigators of contemporary fiction, Sara Paretsky's incomparable character V. I. Warshawski at last returns to the page in her first full-length appearance since 1994's <b>Tunnel Vision</b>. <b>Hard Time</b> is the work of a master--a riveting novel of suspense that is indisputably Paretsky's best V.I. Warshawski novel yet.<br><br>Multimedia conglomerate Global Entertainment has purchased the <i>Chicago Herald-Star,</i> forcing the paper's staff to scramble to stay employed. Reporter Murray Ryerson, V.I.'s longtime friend and sometime rival, manages to reinvent himself as the host of a television show on Global's network. On her way home from a party celebrating Murray's debut, V.I. almost runs over a woman lying in the street. Stopping to help, V.I. soon learns that her Good Samaritan act will drop her squarely in a boiling intrigue. <br><br>In a case that forces her to go head-to-head with one of the world's largest providers of private security and prison services, a case that exposes dark hidden truths behind the razzle-dazzle of the entertainment industry, V.I. will be ahead of the game if she gets out alive.</p><p>V.I. Warshawski, Sara Paretsky's tough-talking, dog-loving, justice-seeking private investigator has been missing in action since 1994, when she ratted out a big city political scandal on the streets of Chicago in <i>Tunnel Vision</i>. But now our Vic is back for her ninth adventure--a wee bit older, a tad more jaded, and as broke as ever. It all begins when Warshawski weasels an invitation to the hottest event in town, a glitzy party celebrating television's brightest new star, Lacey Dowell, or, as she's better known, the Mad Virgin. Vic's old pal (and one-time fling) Murray Ryerson now works for Global Enterprises, the corporate giant behind the Lacey sensation. On the way back from the party, Vic almost runs over a woman lying in the middle of the road, her Mad Virgin T-shirt soaked in blood from an earlier beating. The victim, Nicola Aguinaldo, dies in hospital, and Vic quickly realizes that a particularly nasty cop, Detective Lemour, intends to frame her for vehicular homicide. Her anger at these absurd charges hits the boiling point when Nicola's body disappears from the morgue before an autopsy can be carried out. Why was this woman, an escapee from the local Coolis prison, so important to Lemour? And why does the whole Mad Virgin phenomenon smell so rotten? "I didn't want to dive into Nicola Aguinaldo's wreck," V.I. grouses, "but it felt as though someone had climbed up behind me on the high board to give me a shove." In her search for answers, Warshawski runs afoul of Global Enterprises magnate Edmund Trant, and Robert Baladine, the head honcho of the nation's biggest security firm. They have enough clout to have V.I. thrown into Coolis for another crime she did not commit. But incarceration gives the resourceful Vic a perfect opportunity to snoop into Nicola's last days there--and uncover a sensational scandal.<p> As she has done throughout the series, Paretsky brilliantly juxtaposes strikingly different environments. Here she contrasts the dilapidated environs of the jail with the exorbitant homes of Chicago's filthy rich. In fact, readers who have anxiously awaited V.I. Warshawski's return will be glad to find that little has changed in her world. Mitch and Peppy the wonder dogs are as endearing as ever, her landlord, Mr. Contreras, is his normal fearless self, and V.I. is victorious. It really is like coming home. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p><b>Praise for Sara Paretsky:</b><br><br>"Paretsky's books are beautifully paced and plotted, and the dialogue is fresh and smart."<br>--<i>Newsweek</i><br><br>"Paretsky is still the best . . . she doesn't pull punches."<br>--<i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"Sara Paretsky has hit the big time . . . she gets better and better!"<br>--<i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></p><h2>Rabbit Island</h2><p>The story of two rabbits who escape the rabbit factory.

The book's characters, based on real soldiers and citizens, relate an authentic day-to-day feel of how it all happened, and the bloodshed and inconceivable privations that they endured. Through this unique Southern vantage point, we gain a perspective of the war rarely seen in traditional history books. <p>At the heart of the story are spiritied eighteen-year-old Constance Armstrong and her childhood friend, Frank Stringfellow. Constance, strong and intelligent, supports her family by running a bookstore. Two Rebels and a Yankee vie for her affection amidst the chaos of war. Frank, an irrepressible daredevil, becomes a scout and spy for J.E.B. Stuart and undertakes countless hair-raising adventures. </p><p>On and off the battlefield, Marching Through Culpeper exposes the human side of such heroes as John Pelham, J.E.B. Stuart, A.P. Hill, and George Armstrong Custer. This rich tapestry of life in a war-torn community is a story of the human spirit and the power of love.</p></p><p>I grew up in Richmond and always loved Civil War history and stories. I&#x2019;ve lived in Culpeper for over thirty years, but it was Dr. Daniel Sutherland&#x2019;s excellent book, Seasons of War that truly opened my eyes to the magnitude of the war in Culpeper. At a time when our county was seeking to promote tourism and preserve our priceless battlefields, I determined that a book of historical fiction that brought it all to life was what we needed. I read everything I could get my hands on and the story slowly formed in my mind. Like Kevin Cosner in Field of Dreams, I kept hearing a voice in my head whispering, &#x201c;Write it and they will come.&#x201d; However, the awesome task of getting the story on paper overwhelmed me at times. Frequently I grew discouraged and felt like giving up. When I thought of the hardships my real characters endured, I decided I must persevere and tell their stories to the world. <p>Now, after four and a half years of hard work, I&#x2019;ve had the exhilarating experience of hearing readers discuss my fictional characters as if they were real people. I think, &#x201c;Yes! I&#x2019;ve done it!&#x201d; It is undoubtedly the comments of readers that make the author&#x2019;s task worthwhile. I&#x2019;m thrilled to hear people saying, &#x201c;I loved your book. I cried, I cheered...I couldn&#x2019;t put it down. You brought it all to life for me. Your book would make a wonderful movie!&#x201d; </p><p>In addition, readers are researching their family&#x2019;s Civil War history and coming forward with their personal stories, or telling of their kinship to characters in the book. It&#x2019;s a great re-awakening of our heritage. I&#x2019;m conducting Civil War tours of the town and large numbers of tourists have come to see where it all happened. Most importantly, I enjoy questions from my readers as to what was fact and what was fiction. Please feel free to contact me with comments or questions at vbmorton@edgehillbooks.com.</p>Constance Armstrong, youngest of two daughters, has been raised by her elderly father as the son he never had. Highly intellectual, she shares her father's love of politics. At a picnic, she meets West Point graduate Robert Beckham, whose quiet maturity attracts her. <p>Constance and her father become hotly embroiled in the events that lead to secession. Volunteers flood into Culpeper for training and her childhood friend, Frank Stringfellow, returns determined to join the cavalry. To his chagrin, he is rejected because of his sparse size. He gorges himself to gain weight, captures the pickets of one cavalry unit, and finally gets accepted because of his daring. He goes on to become a scout and is later referred to as "one of the most dangerous men in the Confederacy." </p><p>Following First Manassas, Constance serves as a nurse and becomes enthralled while watching John Pelham train recruits for J.E.B. Stuart's Horse Artillery. During a blizzard, Judge Armstrong finds Pelham's Alabamians without proper shelter and invites them to his house, thus beginning Constance's fascination with the dashing officer. </p><p>In the spring, the Rebels retreat through Culpeper towards Richmond and the Yankees are not far behind. Three Federals pilfer the Armstrong farm and kill an elderly freeman. Several days later, a company of Yankees led by Aaron Ames, a recent Harvard graduate, approach the farm. Furious, Constance brazenly marches out to confront them, then bitterly protests the pilfering. Her beauty and spirit impress Ames. </p><p>Beckham, Pelham, and Ames compete to win her while she struggles to survive the chaos of war. Through the pages of this epic novel march the heroes of both great armies. We share their triumphs, feel their pain, and sense their vulnerability. Virginia B. Morton vividly brings American's deadliest war to life for the reader, giving a you-are-there version of history.</p></p><h2>Glory of Their Times</h2><p><p> Baseball was different in earlier days�&#x20ac;&#x201d;tougher, rawer, more intimate�&#x20ac;&#x201d;when giants like Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb ran the bases.

By the author of A Friend of the Earth. 60,000 first printing.</p><p>With <i>Drop City</i>, T. Coraghessan Boyle offers proof that he has become one of America's most prolific, gifted storytellers. Set in the 1970s, Boyle entertains readers with the denizens of "Drop City," a counterculture California commune that welcomes anyone wanting to live off the grid, use drugs, and practice free love. Boyle sublimely captures the sociology of its rebellious members, who doubt the sincerity or beliefs of newcomers, express some insecurity about nonconformity, and chastise outsiders while remaining oblivious to their own hypocrisy. Marco, Pan, Star, and other "cats" and "chicks" live hassle-free until dissention and cries of racism mount amid increasing run-ins with the local government (a young girl is raped, installation of a sewage system is mandated, a mother lets her toddlers drink LSD-laced juice). Seeking refuge, the citizens move north, to Alaska, to reinvent their utopia, but soon learn the natural environment is more unforgiving of a lackadaisical lifestyle. <p> <i>Drop City</i> is funny, evocative, and well-paced, shifting between the hippies and the Alaskan locals--primarily Sess and his new bride Pamela (a city dweller who arranged stays with several trappers over a few weeks to determine whom she would marry)--until the two cultures collide. Balanced between plot and character, Boyle excels at describing the physical world and his characters' interaction with it, whether portraying the harshness (or sheer beauty) of the Alaskan wilderness, the simple survival routines of its grizzled inhabitants, or the sounds wafting through Drop City: "the goats bleating to be milked or fed, the single sharp ringing note of a dog surprised by its own hunger, the regular slap of the screen door at the back of the house--and underneath it all, like the soundtrack to a movie, the dull hum of rock and roll leaking out the kitchen windows." Truly American in spirit, <i>Drop City</i> is a strong novel of freedom and those in pursuit of lives of liberty. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p>T.C. Boyle is the author of eight novels and six short story collections, all in print from Penguin.

Finding Franklin outlines the larger story and the cast of detectives from every walk of life that led to the discovery, solving one of the Arctic&#x2019;s greatest mysteries. In compelling and accessible prose, Russell Potter details his decades of work alongside key figures in the era of modern searches for the expedition and elucidates how shared research and ideas have led to a fuller understanding of the Franklin crew&#x2019;s final months. Illustrated with numerous images and maps from the last two centuries, Finding Franklin recounts the more than fifty searches for traces of his ships and crew, and the dedicated, often obsessive, men and women who embarked on them. Potter discusses the crucial role that Inuit oral accounts, often cited but rarely understood, played in all of these searches, and continue to play to this day, and offers historical and cultural context to the contemporary debates over the significance of Franklin&#x2019;s achievement. While examination of HMS Erebus will undoubtedly reveal further details of this mystery, Finding Franklin assembles the stories behind the myth and illuminates what is ultimately a remarkable decades-long discovery.</p><p>Russell A. Potter is professor of English at Rhode Island College and the author of Arctic Spectacles: The Frozen North in Visual Culture, 1818-1875."Finding Franklin is a compelling book. Potter is one of the most respected Franklin scholars in the world and this volume shows us why. He has an intimate familiarity with the vast material on the search and understands - better than anyone else - its place within the cultural imagination." Michael F. Robinson, University of Hartford<br><br>"With ambitious scope and profound depth, Potter (Arctic Spectacles) deftly demonstrates that truth can indeed be stranger and more fascinating than fiction ...

Hash browns with apple sauce.</p><p>The list traveled around the energy desk. A formica grey tablet of Biblical proportion, the desk was forty-five feet long. It housed six traders* per side, twelve in all. The senior traders at Allied Power were veterans of the commodities circuit. Most of them had made their bones in big utilities or on the Mercantile Exchange in New York.&nbsp; Of the younger traders, two showed promise. One was a mathematics prodigy who had come up fresh from Cal Tech. The other was a kid named Gallagher from a Minnesota utility. The list complete, Andrews, the boss, passed it to Sami.</p><p>The traders looked up at the mounted flat screen TV with shifty eyes and quiet interest.&nbsp; </p><p>A wild bull was running amok in Kansas City. A train transporting cattle had overturned and one maverick had escaped unharmed, charging off into the urban landscape. The havoc wreaked thus far included a few broken rear-view mirrors, the dented hood of a Cadillac, three resultant fender benders and a five mile backup to the city bound lanes of Route 70. A live broadcast from CNN showed the scene, an indignant brown bull taunting commuters, as he lowered his head and wagged his short stumps of horns at them. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The traders snorted with contempt. The story said it all. The bull market had gone crazy and now apparently it had no fear for the bull was off in Kansas City, trampling on the hood of some hayseed&#x2019;s car. Andrews didn&#x2019;t laugh, though. He was hungry and thinking of yesterday&#x2019;s botched order.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Sami, make sure I get double cream cheese this time, demanded Andrews.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was midmorning on Allied Power&#x2019;s trading floor in Boston. 8:30am. Brokers were already shouting down numbers on squawk boxes even though the New York Mercantile Exchange wouldn&#x2019;t open for another hour and a half.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gallagher, whose broad forehead and round, cherubic face made him resemble an overgrown toddler, sat at his desk, sipping at carton of chocolate milk. Andrews looked at his newest acquisition and furrowed his brow. Traders drank coffee, black.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overnight Natural Gas futures had shot up forty cents. Gallagher allowed himself a tight grin. Miller, the trader who sat across from him, said:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -You got your poker face on, Joe.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gallagher said nothing. His smile was the smile of a simpleton. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Large, who was Gallagher&#x2019;s neighbor to his left, said:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -He&#x2019;s long as balls.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrews stood up and glared across the desk at his young protege. As broad as Gallagher was, Andrew&#x2019;s powerful girth encompassed two of him. Andrews could have easily made the minimum weight requirement to wrestle sumo in Tokyo. Breakfast was on his mind, but when big money was being made it had a sweet smell of its own, one that even trumped food.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -How long are you Joe? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Long, he said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Shut it down before you give it all back. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Natty&#x2019;s going to the moon, said Gallagher. &#x2013;I&#x2019;ll sell when it gets to $9.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Wrong answer, said Andrews.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Gallagher had signed on, he&#x2019;d had an impressive run and Andrews decided to take the young trader under his wing. He had only one doubt about the newcomer: how he&#x2019;d take his first loss. In Andrew&#x2019;s mind trading was about two things, taking profits and enduring pain. Gallagher had not yet shown he could take the pain. Gallagher nodded at Andrews, signaling that he would exit the position. Then he sipped at his chocolate milk. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrews was at his core a family man. Taciturn, moral, occasionally sentimental after twelve beers, his desk was covered with beach and ski vacation photos of his three children and his wife, a striking brunette. An industrious Midwesterner, he was the first to arrive on the desk, last to leave. And while dedicated to his vocation, Andrew&#x2019;s passion laid with his religious beliefs: Chicago Bears football. His place of worship was his den, every Sunday sitting on the couch in front of his TV, baptizing his thirst with a new cold beer every commercial break. As for actual religion, Andrews believed that was a niche market reserved for women and children. When his Iowa born Lutheran wife worried for his immortal soul, Andrews would respond that his status as a taxpayer absolved him from sin and any of the other apparent character flaws he might happen to possess.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrews and the other traders knew very little about Joe Gallagher save that he recently came up from their version of the minors. He seldom drank with them when he first started, and after one night when Gallagher had drank too much, he drank with them not at all. Andrews had certain insights into the nature of his understudy that the others lacked. He was walking by Gallagher&#x2019;s desk one day and saw a small piece of paper taped to his desktop. On it read cryptic words, words that no trader should tape to any desk: </p><p><i>Both the victor and the vanquished</i></p><p><i>Are but drops of dew,</i></p><p><i>But bolts of lightning:</i></p><p><i>Thus should we view the world.</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the other traders left Gallagher to himself. Being a superstitious lot, they suspected from his brooding nature that the residue of a recent misfortune clung to him like bad mojo. Andrews alone reached out to him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I don&#x2019;t know if you saw the memo, said Andrews. &#x2013;We drink coffee here, not milk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Gallagher nodded, remaining silent. Andrews patted down his cowlick of thick blonde hair above his brow with the palm of his hand. It was a habit he had when perturbed.</p><p>After this the men got back to business, the business of taking other people&#x2019;s money. Hurricanes, weather, gas draws, nuke plants coming online, nukes coming offline, coal barges and rail transport disruptions, transmission lines that caused price congestion between the hubs, and then again with the weather. On top of all that, one had to throw crude oil insanity in the mix, the terrorists and psychopathic nuke-wielding leaders with a taste for shoving lit firecrackers in the ass of geopolitics. Predicting gas, oil and electricity futures was an easy job when you happened to be right. It was also easy when you were wrong: You got fired.</p><p>Gallagher finished his chocolate milk and pulled up the commodity news service CQG, which also provided natural gas and crude oil trend charts. There was a record amount of gas in the ground. The economy was sagging because the Republicans were fighting wars that no one believed in. Record supply, waning demand. </p><p>It was there, while sitting at his desk that Gallagher felt his third eye coming on. It was a thing he told no one about, looking at the nat gas bar chart, he sometimes heard a music from the upticks and down ticks, which arranged themselves like notes on a score. Gallagher gazed about the room and felt a truth that no one yet realized. The market was going to rally, a chocolate milk epiphany.</p><p>Still, he had to convince himself. The art of trading lay in good judgment and constant adjustment. </p><p>He looked at the candlestick charts: the monthly, weekly and daily charts all lined up with bullish hammer patterns. As the price of gas ticked higher on the Intercontinental Exchange, an electronic trading platform known as &#x201c;ICE,&#x201d; Joe had the feeling he imagined a general might have before a decisive victory. Tomorrow and the next day were irrelevant. The battle was now. Others were bleeding on the battlefield. His heavy cavalry and tank divisions rolled over them, massacring legions, driving them into the dirt.</p><p>Taste it, as his broker would say.</p><p>Take them to the woodshed.</p><p>Blood on the walls.</p><p>As gas rallied, his adversaries who had sold to him at much lower levels suffered as electronic dollars, their lifeblood, went pouring into Gallagher&#x2019;s trading book. He tried to wear his invincibility with an air of grim silence like he&#x2019;d seen Andrews do. Andrews, always adept with football analogies, had a line about how to act when making money. He likened it to a trip to the end zone:</p><p>-Act like you&#x2019;ve been there before.</p><p>*</p><p>-Here&#x2019;s the goat, said Miller, shaking his head.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Sorry, said Sami, out of breath, holding a cardboard box with eleven white paper bags.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Beatings, said Miller. -You being late every day isn&#x2019;t the way to get off breakfast detail.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -He&#x2019;s pledging for life, chuckled Large.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sami walked around the desk passing out the breakfast sandwiches. As he handed them out, Sami would recite each order with an exasperated optimism. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Miller: Double egg over easy, bacon and tomato on toasted bagel!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Churchill: Bacon, Ham, egg and cheese on English muffin!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Large: Two pancakes wrapped with cream cheese, bacon side!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Hutchinson: Double sausage and potato 3 egg omelet. Side order onion rings!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gallagher, who was too cheap to order take out, was eating his second peanut butter on a bagel, which he&#x2019;d brought from home. Sami went down the rows reciting and handing out the orders, wondering the whole time why he bothered to get an MBA from Yale. This bullshit was the kind of racism that his Pakistani father had warned him about.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sami gave his least favorite co-worker, Andrews, his order last. Once this task was done Sami returned to his desk, and got back to work, thinking, defeat is only temporary. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today it was not.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Yo, Goat. What the hell? Said Andrews. -I ordered double cream cheese on these. You blew it again.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sami stood up and approached the angry veteran trader. Andrews held out the bag and without another word handed it over to Sami. As Sami made his way off the trading floor towards the elevators, he heard Andrews bellow:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Pledging for life.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Andrews lambasted him, Sami moved toward the door of the trading floor. Gallagher held out his hand and took the breakfast order from Sami.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I&#x2019;ll go get it, said Gallagher standing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sami put a hand on Gallagher&#x2019;s back.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Thanks Joe.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Gallagher left the floor, Andrews shouted:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Two goats are better than one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Gallagher returned with the two double cream cheese &amp; bacon bagels, he noticed the absence of chatter. Leslie Moran had wafted in and taken the buzz of the trading floor to zero. She worked in legal and usually her presence signaled evil tidings like Sarbanes-Oxley regulations and time consuming HR seminars on trading ethics. However, her beauty quieted the traders, although she did cause some like Dave Vern from Mississippi to scratch themselves and others to sniff the air for her scent. The traders tried to make her something of their own and secretly they called her Max Gen. This referred to &#x201c;maximum generation,&#x201d; a phenomena that occurred on extremely hot summer days when all available power units on the grid had to run to cover demand. On this morning Max Gen was wearing a tight-fitting white blouse. A whisper went across the desk.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Joe, said Miller. &#x2013;You see Max Gen today? That shit is printing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the prospect of making a killing in the market, Gallagher was keeping to himself. As Max Gen breezed by, his head was the only one in the row that did not turn her way. He was thinking about covering his position. The markets were not always rational, and often moved violently. They were after all a product of the people that traded them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking about the violent, irrational nature of traders, Gallagher recalled that day seven years ago when he had just started in the biz, working in the pits of the MERC in New York. It was a cautionary memory, a visceral illustration of the emotional nature of markets and how sometimes the machinery that comprised the market could go insane.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p></p><h2>Building with Diligence, English 4 Worksheets</h2><p>68 worksheets for Building With Diligence.

Ben, the kind, alcoholic janitor from <i>The Women of Brewster Place</i> returns as a mythical minstrel of sorts, wandering in and out of the lives of Brewster's male denizens, introducing their stories, each a quest for the meaning of <i>manhood</i>.<p>For autistic Brother Jerome, masculine identity comes in the form of a rickety upright piano whose missing keys and wobbly wires burst to life when he plays. Jerome plays so well (better than Count Basie, mind you) that his hedonistic mother decides not to institutionalize him so she can charge for his performances. Eugene, however, has a more difficult act to shore: he's married, he's a father, and he's gay. Ceil, his wife, doesn't know that's why he keeps leaving, so she takes family matters into her own hands and sends Eugene into a bottomless pit of guilt and self-loathing. Basil looks for his redemption in a contemptuous trash bag named Keisha and her two beautiful, neglected sons, Jason and Eddie. Will Basil find atonement for his sins against his mother if he gives those boys what he never received as a child? The men of Brewster Place continue to stream into the story in raw, biting vignettes until the stage is full and the future of their community is threatened. Can these men come together and reclaim what's theirs? The answer lies at the root of self-worth and sexual identity. Or, in the words of Ben, "Brewster Place is a small street but it seems there's an endless supply of I coulda, I shoulda, but didn't. Can you call it any man's blues? I don't know, but you can definitely call it the black man's blues." <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>The Women of Brewster Place launched Gloria Naylor and was filmed for television. Now the author returns to the housing project on Brewster with a similar series of first-person narratives of its male inhabitants. Joe Morton--an excellent, if colorless, actor--impersonates these men, while the author herself bridges each section as the spirit of the place. Both do a nice job--especially Morton, who reins in the book&#39;s melodrama and sentimentality. Y.R.

As if each Christmas season is part of some larger work in progress, like pearls on a string. One precious bead added each year. Every decoration, taken from its hiding place, speaks to me, telling its particular story. Each ornament, music box, wooden bear, or snow globe summons vivid memories. </p><p>When I was very young, my father worked for a company that imported Christmas ornaments from Europe. These handmade decorations were very fine, made of hand-blown glass, painstakingly painted and decorated&#x2014;skiers and ice-skaters, ballerinas and angels. An entire set of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. A blue candle with a miniature nativity scene inside, a fragile glass shadow box. As Christmas drew closer, my father would come home each night with mysterious packages, and we would sit in awe as the newest treasures were unveiled. I still remember those slim brown boxes tied with string coming through the door, and feeling so eager to see what was inside. </p><p>When my parents sold the family home, they passed these family heirlooms on to me and my sister. No matter how carefully preserved, only a few have survived. When I hang them on our tree, I am instantly transported back in time to golden hours. But now these antique ornaments hang alongside newer treasures, definitely made of sturdier stuff, but with no less claim on a place in my heart&#x2019;s scrapbook.</p><p>In this book Reverend Ben is also transported back into the past, to his very first Christmas in Cape Light. He recalls the many challenges and joys the season brought to him, while in the present, his daughter, Rachel, wonders if she can open her heart and trust the gifts that this Christmas brings.</p><p>So it is with all of our Christmas traditions and memories. As the beloved carol &#x201c;Silent Night&#x201d; reminds us, &#x201c;All is calm. All is bright.&#x201d; The beauty of Christmas past and Christmas present, shining together, with one steady light. </p><p>And while I fully intend to relish my memories this Christmas, as I do every year, I will also be mindful and grateful for the present moment&#x2014;the memories in the making. And so many blessings received at Christmas and all year through. I truly hope you will, too.</p><p>With all best wishes,<br>Katherine Spencer</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Present day, December 3</p><p>Reverend Ben had forgotten all about the meeting. It was already late afternoon when he emerged from his office, coat and briefcase in hand. He had planned to leave the church early and look in on Dr. Elliot, who had been home with bronchitis over Thanksgiving weekend.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you leaving for the day, Reverend?&#x201d; Mrs. Honeyfield abruptly looked up from her keyboard. &#x201c;What about the meeting?&#x201d; Before he could ask the obvious question, his secretary added, &#x201c;About the church history?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh right&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was that today?&#x201d; He noticed the rising sound of voices in the conference room. The group must have started without him.</p><p>&#x201c;Wednesday at four. I left a sticky note on your calendar.&#x201d; Mrs. Honeyfield politely looked back at her computer.</p><p>&#x201c;Guess I missed it.&#x201d; That was true. Though he wasn&#x2019;t sure how. His secretary&#x2019;s sticky notes were growing progressively brighter as he grew older. The little squares had started off a bland, pale yellow and now fairly screamed at him in neon pink and roadwork orange.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better get in there.&#x201d; Ben set his coat on a chair. &#x201c;Would you call Mrs. Warwick&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean, Mrs. Elliot,&#x201d; he quickly corrected himself. &#x201c;Please tell her I&#x2019;ve been delayed. I can stop by after five. Or tomorrow. Whatever she prefers.&#x201d;</p><p>It went without saying that Lillian Elliot would not hesitate to state her preference. He would always think of her as Lillian Warwick, though her surname had changed a few years back when she and her longtime friend, Ezra Elliot, were married. The well-earned triumph of a patient heart&#x2014;Dr. Elliot&#x2019;s, that is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not Lillian&#x2019;s, to be sure.</p><p>But it was now clear to all that Lillian&#x2019;s devotion equally matched that of her husband. With Ezra fighting off the flu, Ben thought he should visit. Lillian liked to give the impression that she didn&#x2019;t care one way or another about such attentions from her minister. He could almost see her shrugging a thin shoulder. But Ben knew&#x2014;after nearly forty years as Lillian&#x2019;s pastor&#x2014;that the great lady did care. And felt it was her due.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, Reverend. I&#x2019;ll call her right away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Mrs. Honeyfield. Where would I be without you?&#x201d;</p><p>She answered with a small smile. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say, Reverend. But probably not at your meetings.&#x201d;</p><p>Ben laughed and headed to the conference room. Meetings&#x2014;and more meetings&#x2014;the chugging engine that kept his little church moving down the track. Often slow and ponderous, prone to sudden stops and unsettling puffs of steam. But sooner or later, all the passengers were carried where they needed to go, their progress slow but steady.</p><p>This afternoon&#x2019;s meeting was about producing a church history, a book that would be sold to raise funds for the church&#x2019;s many service projects in the community: the community garden in the spring, free books and school supplies given out to schoolchildren in the fall, the gifts and toys for struggling families at Christmas, the food pantry, open all year long, and so many other worthy efforts made by his congregation.</p><p>Even without that benefit, the book would be a wonderful way to preserve the church&#x2019;s long, colorful story and the contributions of so many generations, dating back to the seventeenth century.</p><p>The history had been Sophie Potter&#x2019;s idea, and a good one, though it would take long hours of complicated work to see it through. But despite the challenges, the group was eager to try their hand at it.</p><p>&#x201c;What is now proved was once only imagined,&#x201d; the poet William Blake had written. It was one of the amazing things about this world, Ben often reflected. How God inspires us to create, bestowing an idea and a vision and the energy and means to follow through if we only have the faith to try what appears at first to be difficult&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or even impossible.</p><p>He entered the conference room, a few doors down from the office, and greeted the members of the committee. &#x201c;Hello, everyone. Sorry I&#x2019;m late.&#x201d;</p><p>He glanced around the table and took the nearest empty seat, noticing his wife, Carolyn, seated directly across the table. He met her bright blue eyes with a smile.</p><p>Sophie Potter, the committee chairperson, sat at the head of the table, an impressive array of papers and folders spread around her.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve just been discussing what needs to be done and sorting out the jobs, Reverend. Vera and Claire have volunteered to write the text,&#x201d; she added, referring to longtime church members Vera Plante and Claire North. &#x201c;Carolyn and I will work on the research, and Grace Hegman is going to put the whole thing together, figuring out where the pictures go and all that. She&#x2019;s made some beautiful scrapbooks and collections of vintage photographs about town history and the fishermen of her father&#x2019;s day. Have you ever seen them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never had the pleasure,&#x201d; Ben admitted, glancing at Grace, who tilted her head in her modest way. She was a quiet and sensitive soul, but very observant. Ben didn&#x2019;t doubt her scrapbooks were wonderful. And Sophie sounded so sure of her assignments. But so much was done on computers these days, especially making a book of this kind. Did Grace Hegman, an expert on all things antique and vintage, know enough about the necessary technological shortcuts? Before he could voice his concerns, Vera Plante spoke up.</p><p>&#x201c;Dan Forbes offered to edit the manuscript and put everything on the computer for us so we can have it printed at the lowest cost.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wonderful. He can keep his eye on the historical facts, too,&#x201d; Ben added. Though he trusted the group to do an excellent job researching the church&#x2019;s story, he was happy to hear that the former reporter and editor-in-chief of the town newspaper was on board as well. Dan would doubtlessly lend a professional touch. After handing over the<i> Cape Light Messenger </i>to his daughter Lindsay, he had written and published several books about local history. Working at home, he had been doing most of the child care for his younger daughter, Jane, while his wife, Mayor Emily Warwick, ran the town.</p><p>&#x201c;I think Emily persuaded him to take part. She wanted to help, but has her plate full, as usual,&#x201d; Claire explained.</p><p>Sophie made a note on a yellow pad. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s also going to check the newspaper archives for articles about the church.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That will be a huge help for the researchers,&#x201d; Carolyn said. &#x201c;Meanwhile, we have a job for you, Ben.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For me?&#x201d; Ben fumbled to hide his surprise. He was happy to give his opinions and oversee, but didn&#x2019;t expect to be doing any hands-on work. Maybe they wanted him to write an introduction or a letter to the reader?</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an important job.&#x201d; Sophie stood up and took a large brown box with a lid from a table near the door. Ben hadn&#x2019;t even noticed it until that moment.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d; he asked quickly. Sophie was healthy and strong, but she was well over eighty. It was only polite to offer.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, but it doesn&#x2019;t weigh much. About half a bushel of McIntosh, maybe less.&#x201d; Sophie had run an orchard all her life and tended to judge the world in terms of apples. Reverend Ben couldn&#x2019;t help but smile.</p><p>He sat down again and she set the box at the end of the table. It looked like the kind used to store files, though he could tell by the way she carried it that it was not filled with piles of paper, but something lighter.</p><p>She removed the lid and Ben inhaled a musty scent, even at a distance. &#x201c;We found quite a few boxes of photographs stored around the church. We&#x2019;re taking turns sorting them out, trying to identify who&#x2019;s in the pictures and when and where they were taken, and selecting any that could be included in our book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can help with that. I love looking at old photos,&#x201d; Ben said sincerely.</p><p>&#x201c;We were hoping you would say that. You&#x2019;ve been at the church a long time, Reverend.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I have,&#x201d; he replied with a laugh. He&#x2019;d been called by the congregation over thirty-five years ago. He&#x2019;d been just thirty-one years old, relatively young to head his own church. But he arrived with great confidence and faith that he was ready for the job&#x2014;and was soon disabused of those illusions. Ben smiled to himself, thinking back to that rocky first year in Cape Light when both his maturity and his faith had been tested.</p><p>&#x201c;Most of you have been here even longer,&#x201d; he pointed out.</p><p>&#x201c;No argument there,&#x201d; Sophie agreed. &#x201c;But there are a lot of photos. Why don&#x2019;t you start with this box, and we&#x2019;ll put a few more in your office later this week?&#x201d;</p><p>A few more? There must have been about a thousand photos in the single carton on the table. He could see his wife suppress a laugh.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take this home and we can look at it tonight, Ben.&#x201d; Carolyn slid the box toward her end of the table. &#x201c;It will be fun. Better than watching television,&#x201d; she promised him.</p><p>His wife had such a graceful way of smoothing over an awkward moment. It was a quality he had always loved in her.</p><p>He nodded and forced a smile. &#x201c;Anything for the cause. I wasn&#x2019;t sure about this project when you suggested it, Sophie. But I think this book is going to be wonderful; a chance to honor the past and everyone who helped build our church. And a very special gift to the members who enjoy it now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s our mission, Reverend,&#x201d; Vera replied. &#x201c;So many people down through the generations have had a hand in making the church what it is now. There are so many fascinating stories. It won&#x2019;t be dull reading, to be sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We aim to be truthful, too,&#x201d; Claire added. &#x201c;A real history, including the rough times. There were a few.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I agree. Let&#x2019;s not gloss over the facts. Though that&#x2019;s not nearly as easy as it sounds,&#x201d; he warned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tried my hand a few times at writing nonfiction accounts, and capturing the truth of a matter can be very elusive.&#x201d;</p><p>Like an optical illusion that can transform before your eyes, he had learned.</p><p>&#x201c;Another reason we&#x2019;re glad Dan is working with us,&#x201d; Claire noted. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll keep us on the straight and narrow.&#x201d;</p><p>Ben agreed&#x2014;and also hoped the former newspaper editor would help sort through all the photos. For one thing, Dan would be far better at picking the best pictures for the book. And for another, it appeared the group could use all the help they could get with that task.</p><p>He glanced at the large box, which all but obscured the sight of his lovely wife. They would hardly make a dent in it tonight, he predicted, even if they looked through the photos for hours.</p><p>It turned out Ben was accurate with that guess. It was nearly eleven that night, and he and Carolyn still sat together in the living room, their reading glasses perched on their noses, shielding bleary eyes. Piles of old photographs were mounded on the dining room table. They had devised a system for sorting them, though Ben kept forgetting the categories and had to ask Carolyn each time he wanted to put one down.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a Christmas pageant. Oh, there&#x2019;s a date on back, 1967. The wise men are all wearing Beatles haircuts,&#x201d; he added, looking up at her.</p><p>&#x201c;It took me a while to get used to that style. But I think it seems very cute and harmless now,&#x201d; Carolyn murmured. &#x201c;Oh, look at this.&#x201d; She bounced up in her seat and held out a large sepia-toned photo that looked more like a formal portrait than a casual snapshot. Ben guessed it had been taken with an old-fashioned box camera.</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like this baby was just baptized. There are the parents and godparents&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the minister.&#x201d; Carolyn pointed, but didn&#x2019;t touch the delicate old photo.</p><p>Ben took in the beautiful clothing of the era: the long, draping dresses of the women, with their bobbed hair and soft eyes; the stiff, high-necked shirts and vested suits on the gentlemen. &#x201c;Babies wore long gowns for a christening in the old days&#x2014;girls and boys,&#x201d; he added, noticing the lace edges on the baby&#x2019;s flowing, snowy white gown. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beautiful photo, a real masterpiece.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And definitely has possibilities for the book. If we can just figure out who&#x2019;s in it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She turned the photo over, then held it under the lamp on the end table. Ben noticed some pale, scratchy writing. &#x201c;June sixth, nineteen twenty-five. Baptism of Dennis&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hegman. Reverend John Bingham presiding.&#x201d; She looked over at Ben. &#x201c;Dennis Hegman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some relation to Grace?&#x201d;</p><p>Ben laughed. &#x201c;Indeed he is. That&#x2019;s Digger,&#x201d; he said, identifying Grace&#x2019;s father by his well-known nickname. &#x201c;Dennis is his given name.&#x201d;</p><p>Carolyn looked shocked, then stared back at the photo. &#x201c;That adorable infant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is Digger? Where did those plump, dimpled cheeks go?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They might have been hidden under his beard all these years,&#x201d; Ben suggested. &#x201c;You could check next time you see him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take your word for it.&#x201d; Carolyn examined the photo again. &#x201c;I never heard anyone call him D...</p></p><h2>Malaparte: A House Like Me</h2><p>Of this special limited edition, one hundred copies have been produced, numbered 1 to 100, and signed by the author, Michael McDonough. Malaparte: A House Like Me (Limited Edition) offers an extraordinary look at Malaparte, the man and the house. Often called the most beautiful house in the world, Casa Malaparte in Capri, Italy, is dramatically sited on a promontory overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. It was home to Curzio Malaparte (1898-1957), the Italian writer who designed the building. A perpetual enigma, he still confounds nearly all who care to look. Actor, novelist, poet, filmmaker, soldier, playwright, journalist, political figure, prisoner, composer, charmer - inventor and revealer of truths - Malaparte associated with Mussolini and Stalin, vilified Hitler, and admired Mao. He was a journalist in London, a collaborator with the Surrealists in Paris, and a war correspondent in Berlin and on the Russian front. Casa come me, he called the building - house like me - inviting endless speculation as to what meaning lay within. Much as Picasso, Breton, Pound, Eliot and Godard discovered the house and its legendary owner earlier in the century, such international personalities as Robert Venturi, Emilio Ambasz, Willem Dafoe, Steven Holl, Michael Graves, Peter Eisenman, Arata Isozaki, Louis Cha, Carla Fendi, James Wines, and Karl Lagerfeld have created this special portfolio embodying unique insights into the controversial artist and his provocative home. A work of art in itself, Malaparte: A House Like Me includes a series of photographs produced especially by the renowned Italian photographer Mimmo Jodice, archival materials and documents, poetry, original art, letters, memoirs, commentaries, and an original musical score. Organized and edited by noted architect, designer, and writer Michael McDonough, this remarkable book ultimately celebrates Casa Malaparte&#39;s enigmatic contradictions, seeing it as a living literary work, an autobiography, and a mysterious tabula rasa: a house that lives in myth.</p><p>rte: A House Like Me offers an extraordinary look at Malaparte, the man and the house.

Her narrative evokes the smell of raw, wet earth from her Finger Lakes childhood, the red rock of the Egyptian desert she travels, dead Greek words she studied &#34;like shards of some wonderful glass,&#34; and fluid Arabic where &#34;a name is a mirror to catch the soul of a thing, and a pun is the corner of its garment.&#34; Seeking desert solace for her siblings&#39; deaths, Brind adventures through Egypt&#39;s Red Sea Hills and Sudan&#39;s wadis, studying the birth of language amid its natural, living origins.Travels in Egypt, encumbered by passages of purple prose, from the wife of writer Lance Morrow. North Africa has long inspired intrepid literary travelers, including Isabelle Eberhardt, the turn-of-the-century author-adventuress who disguised herself as a man for her travels, and the singular 19th-century wanderer and prose stylist Charles Doughty. Morrow's fascination with Egypt grew slowly out of a classical education at Barnard College and an internship at the Brooklyn Museum (with its fabulous Egyptian collection), but it didn't turn into a love affair until she actually set foot there. She soon graduated from a peripatetic assistant's position on an archaeological survey in the Western Desert to an open-ended traveling fellowship in Egypt and the Sudan. Morrow's impressionistic series of reminiscences of her journeys from Aswan to the Red Sea show considerable erudition, often buried under pretentious prose. After her protracted grief over the deaths of her older sister and brother, she writes, Egypt ``as raw environment'' was ``like a knife cutting away the frozen parts of myself.'' Among her therapeutically rich and exotic experiences is a visit to a Cairo fortune-teller, who diagnoses an angry qarin (``my male twin, my invisible brother''). Such are the episodes in her ``passage from one state to another'': moving from city to desert, revitalizing the dead languages she studied with firsthand observations, and living as an ``honorary man'' in Muslim society. Morrow has a venturesome spirit and possesses an eye for character, as displayed in her account of a lengthy trip to the Sudan by ferry and a semifarcical encounter with an underage border-patrol soldier. Travel writing in the grab-bag meditative mode, but hampered by self-conscious desert rhapsodies. (illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Yet this strife-torn<br>land is also the birthplace of the world's favorite wine: champagne.</p><p>In this engrossing history, <strong>Don and Petie Kladstrup</strong> show how this sparkling wine, born of bloodshed, became a symbol of glamour, good times, and celebration. It's a story filled with larger-than-life characters:Dom P�rignon, the father of champagne, who, contrary to popular belief, worked his entire life to keep bubbles out of champagne; the Sun King, Louis XIV, who rarely drank anything but; and Napoleon, who, in trying to conquer the world, introduced it to champagne.</p><p>Then there were the generations of local vintners who struggled to keep their houses running. Claude Mo�t hauled his bottles to Versailles and gave Madame de Pompadour her first taste of bubbly, prompting her memorable quote, "Champagne is the only wine that lets a woman remain beautiful after she has drunk it." There was also Charles-Camille Heidsieck, known as "Champagne Charlie," who popularized champagne in America and ended up being imprisoned as a spy during the Civil War.</p><p>World War I would be Champagne's greatest test of all, a four-year nightmare in which nearly everything the Champenois had worked and fought for was destroyed "in a rain of iron and fire." German bombardment drove thousands of people underground to seek refuge in the huge cellars of the champagne houses, where among the bottles you would find schools, hospitals, shops, municipal offices, and troops.</p><p>Amazingly, grapes continued to be harvested even as bombs fell, and the wartime vintages are considered to be among the finest ever made.</p><p>An unforgettable history, <strong>Champagne</strong> will forever change how you look at a glass of bubbly.</p></p><p><p>Don and Petie Kladstrup are former journalists who have written extensively about wine and France for numerous publications.

It is All Souls Day, and the spirit of Marcus Conway sits at his kitchen table and remembers. In flowing, relentless prose, Conway recalls his life in rural Ireland: as a boy and man, father, husband, citizen. His ruminations move from childhood memories of his father&#x2019;s deftness with machines to his own work as a civil engineer, from transformations in the local economy to the tidal wave of global financial collapse. Conway&#x2019;s thoughts go still further, outward to the vast systems of time and history that hold us all. He stares down through the &#x201c;vortex of his being,&#x201d; surveying all the linked circumstances that combined to bring him into this single moment, and he makes us feel, if only for an instant, all the terror and gratitude that existence inspires.</p><p>Mike McCormack is an award-winning novelist and short story writer from County Mayo in Ireland.

through hail and gale<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hell and high water<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men with bellies and short tempers, half of whom went to their graves with pains in their chests before they were sixty, good singers many of them, all<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adding to the home place down the generations till it swelled to twenty acres, grazing and tillage, with access to open commonage on Carramore hill which overlooks the bay and<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this pain, this fucking pain tells me that<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the best of my knowledge<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knowledge being the best of me, that<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is something strange about all this, some twitchy energy in the ether which has affected me from the moment<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

alone here for four hours<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; four hours till she returns so<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there must be some way of filling the span of time that now spreads out ahead of me, something to cut through this gnawing unease because<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

thresholds to cross<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things to be settled<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; checks to be run<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as if I had stepped into a narrow circumstance bordered around by oblivion while<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

not one but two of them, local and national, both lying in the middle of the table neatly folded into each other, the light glossing unbroken across their surface, making it clear she has not read them herself that I might have the small pleasure of opening up a fresh newspaper, hearing it rattle and creak as it discloses itself, one of those experiences which properly begin the day or the afternoon as is the case now, turning it over and leafing through it<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Reissue.</p><p>reS-Gr 2-The determined, bright, and adorable West Highland terrier is back as he welcomes new neighbors and a new language. McDuff's strong-willed nature places him in obedience school, where he has the potential to earn a blue ribbon at graduation. While the dog finds his family too busy to practice, he listens attentively to the routines of his Scottie friend Marie-Antoinette and her French owners; to his family's surprise, he has learned the commands in another language. The French phrases may prove difficult for the pup's youngest fans, but the endearing illustrations of canine faces and exuberant paws in action transcend any additional need for explanation. Jeffers's art perfectly complements Wells's simple text and captures an earlier era, seemingly the '30s, with perspectives that emphasize the dogs that play an important role in their owners' lives. A short illustrated glossary and pronunciation guide to the obedience commands are included.<p></p><p><i>Mary Elam, Forman Elementary School, Plano, TX</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Ages 2-5.

Jeffers' illustrations catch the look of a 1940s English village that suits the comfortable feel of the tale. Terrier McDuff meets his new neighbor, a French terrier named Marie Antoinette, who responds "Ouf" to McDuff's "Woof." After McDuff acts up at the new neighbors' house, he's sent to obedience school, and Marie Antoinette goes along.

That triumph, shared with her teacher Anne Sullivan, has been further popularized by the play and movie <em>The Miracle Worker</em>. Yet the astonishing original version of Keller's and Sullivan's story, first published in 1903, has been out of print for many years and lost to the public.<br><br> Now, one hundred years after its initial publication, eminent literary scholar Roger Shattuck, in collaboration with Keller biographer Dorothy Herrmann, has reedited the book to reflect more accurately its original composition. Keller's remarkable acquisition of language is presented here in three successive accounts: Keller's own version; the letters of "teacher" Anne Sullivan, submerged in the earliest edition; and the valuable documentation by their young assistant, John Macy. Including opening and closing commentary by Shattuck and notes by Hermann, this volume will stand for years as the definitive edition of a classic work. 10 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Helen Keller would not be bound by conditions. Rendered deaf and blind at 19 months by scarlet fever, she learned to read (in several languages) and even speak, eventually graduating with honors from Radcliffe College in 1904, where as a student she wrote <i>The Story of My Life</i>. That she accomplished all of this in an age when few women attended college and the disabled were often relegated to the background, spoken of only in hushed tones, is remarkable. But Keller's many other achievements are impressive by any standard: she authored 13 books, wrote countless articles, and devoted her life to social reform. An active and effective suffragist, pacifist, and socialist (the latter association earned her an FBI file), she lectured on behalf of disabled people everywhere. She also helped start several foundations that continue to improve the lives of the deaf and blind around the world.<p> As a young girl Keller was obstinate, prone to fits of violence, and seething with rage at her inability to express herself. But at the age of 7 this wild child was transformed when, at the urging of Alexander Graham Bell, Anne Sullivan became her teacher, an event she declares "the most important day I remember in all my life." (Sullivan herself had once been blind, but partially recovered her sight after a series of operations.) In a memorable passage, Keller writes of the day "Teacher" led her to a stream and repeatedly spelled out the letters <i>w-a-t-e-r</i> on one of her hands while pouring water over the other. This method proved a revelation: "That living world awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free! There were barriers still, it is true, but barriers that could in time be swept away." And, indeed, most of them were. </p><p> In her lovingly crafted and deeply perceptive autobiography, Keller's joyous spirit is most vividly expressed in her connection to nature:</p><p> </p><blockquote> Indeed, everything that could hum, or buzz, or sing, or bloom, had a part in my education.... Few know what joy it is to feel the roses pressing softly into the hand, or the beautiful motion of the lilies as they sway in the morning breeze. Sometimes I caught an insect in the flower I was plucking, and I felt the faint noise of a pair of wings rubbed together in a sudden terror.... </blockquote><p> The idea of feeling rather than hearing a sound, or of admiring a flower's motion rather than its color, evokes a strong visceral sensation in the reader, giving <i>The Story of My Life</i> a subtle power and beauty. Keller's celebration of discovery becomes our own. In the end, this blind and deaf woman succeeds in sharpening our eyes and ears to the beauty of the world. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>When she was 19 months old, Helen Keller (1880&#x2013;1968) suffered a severe illness that left her blind and deaf. Not long after, she also became mute. Her tenacious struggle to overcome these handicaps-with the help of her inspired teacher, Anne Sullivan-is one of the great stories of human courage and dedication. In this classic autobiography, first published in 1903, Miss Keller recounts the first 22 years of her life, including the magical moment at the water pump when, recognizing the connection between the word "water" and the cold liquid flowing over her hand, she realized that objects had names. Subsequent experiences were equally noteworthy: her joy at eventually learning to speak, her friendships with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Edward Everett Hale and other notables, her education at Radcliffe (from which she graduated cum laude), and-underlying all-her extraordinary relationship with Miss Sullivan, who showed a remarkable genius for communicating with her eager and quick-to-learn pupil. These and many other aspects of Helen Keller's life are presented here in clear, straightforward prose full of wonderful descriptions and imagery that would do credit to a sighted writer. Completely devoid of self-pity, yet full of love and compassion for others, this deeply moving memoir offers an unforgettable portrait of one of the outstanding women of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Mastering Herringbone Stitch: The Complete Guide</h2><p><p><b>A fresh and thorough approach to learning and mastering herringbone stitch!</b></p><p>A follow-up to <i>Mastering Peyote Stitch</i>, <i>Mastering Herringbone Stitch</i> provides a solid overview to the second-most popular beadweaving technique--herringbone stitch.

Like a detective movie. First, stand in front of Florsheim&#39;s Fifty-seventh Street window, press your face close to the glass, watch the fake velvet Hummels inside revolving around the wing tips; some white shoes, like your father wears, are propped up with garlands on a small mound of chemical snow. All the stores have closed. You can see your breath on the glass. Draw a peace sign. You are waiting for a bus.He emerges from nowhere, looks like Robert Culp, the fog rolling, then parting, then sort of closing up again behind him. He asks you for a light and you jump a bit, startled, but you give him your &#34;Lucky&#39;s Lounge--Where Leisure Is a Suit&#34; matches. He has a nice chuckle, nice fingernails. He lights the cigarette, cupping his hands around the end, and drags deeply, like a starving man. He smiles as he exhales, returns you the matches, looks at your face, says: &#34;Thanks.&#34;He then stands not far from you, waiting. Perhaps for the same bus. The two of you glance furtively at each other, shifting feet. Pretend to contemplate the chemical snow. You are two spies glancing quickly at watches, necks disappearing in the hunch of your shoulders, collars upturned and slowly razoring the cab and store-lit fog like sharkfins. You begin to circle, gauging each other in primordial sniffs, eyeing, sidling, keen as Basil Rathbone.A bus arrives. It is crowded, everyone looking laughlessly into one another&#39;s underarms. A blonde woman in barrettes steps off, holding her shoes in one hand.You climb on together, grab adjacent chrome posts, and when the bus hisses and rumbles forward, you take out a book. A minute goes by and he asks what you&#39;re reading. It is Madame Bovary in a Doris Day biography jacket. Try to explain about binding warpage. He smiles, interested.Return to your book. Emma is opening her window, thinking of Rouen.&#34;What weather,&#34; you hear him sigh, faintly British or uppercrust Delaware.Glance up. Say: &#34;It is fit for neither beast nor vegetable.&#34;It sounds dumb. It makes no sense.But it is how you meet.At the movies he is tender, caressing your hand beneath the seat.At concerts he is sweet and attentive, buying cocktails, locating the ladies&#39; lounge when you can&#39;t find it.At museums he is wise and loving, leading you slowly through the Etruscan cinerary urns with affectionate gestures and an art history minor from Columbia. He is kind; he laughs at your jokes.After four movies, three concerts, and two-and-a-half museums, you sleep with him. It seems the right number of cultural events. On the stereo you play your favorite harp and oboe music. He tells you his wife&#39;s name. It is Patricia. She is an intellectual property lawyer. He tells you he likes you a lot. You lie on your stomach, naked and still too warm. When he says, &#34;How do you feel about that?&#34; don&#39;t say &#34;Ridiculous&#34; or &#34;Get the hell out of my apartment.&#34; Prop your head up with one hand and say: &#34;It depends. What is intellectual property law?&#34;He grins. &#34;Oh, you know. Where leisure is a suit.&#34;Give him a tight, wiry little smile.&#34;I just don&#39;t want you to feel uncomfortable about this,&#34; he says.Say: &#34;Hey. I am a very cool person. I am tough.&#34; Show him your bicep.When you were six you thought mistress meant to put your shoes on the wrong feet. Now you are older and know it can mean many things, but essentially it means to put your shoes on the wrong feet.You walk differently. In store windows you don&#39;t recognize yourself; you are another woman, some crazy interior display lady in glasses stumbling frantic and preoccupied through the mannequins. In public restrooms you sit dangerously flat against the toilet seat, a strange flesh sundae of despair and exhilaration, murmuring into your bluing thighs: &#34;Hello, I&#39;m Charlene. I&#39;m a mistress.&#34;It is like having a book out from the library.It is like constantly having a book out from the library.You meet frequently for dinner, after work, split whole liters of the house red, then wamble the two blocks east, twenty blocks south to your apartment and lie sprawled on the living room floor with your expensive beige raincoats still on.He is a systems analyst--you have already exhausted this joke--but what he really wants to be, he reveals to you, is an actor.&#34;Well, how did you become a systems analyst?&#34; you ask, funny you.&#34;The same way anyone becomes anything,&#34; he muses. &#34;I took courses and sent out resumes.&#34; Pause. &#34;Patricia helped me work up a great resume. Too great.&#34;&#34;Oh.&#34; Wonder about mistress courses, certification, resumes. Perhaps you are not really qualified.&#34;But I&#39;m not good at systems work,&#34; he says, staring through and beyond, way beyond, the cracked ceiling. &#34;Figuring out the cost-effectiveness of two hundred people shuffling five hundred pages back and forth across a new four-and-a-half-by-three-foot desk. I&#39;m not an organized person, like Patricia, for instance. She&#39;s just incredibly organized. She makes lists for everything. It&#39;s pretty impressive.&#34;Say flatly, dully: &#34;What?&#34; &#34;That she makes lists.&#34;&#34;That she makes lists? You like that?&#34;&#34;Well, yes. You know, what she&#39;s going to do, what she has to buy, names of clients she has to see, et cetera.&#34;&#34;Lists?&#34; you murmur hopelessly, listlessly, your expensive beige raincoat still on. There is a long, tired silence. Lists? You stand up, brush off your coat, ask him what he would like to drink, then stump off to the kitchen without waiting for the answer.At one-thirty, he gets up noiselessly except for the soft rustle of his dressing. He leaves before you have even quite fallen asleep, but before he does, he bends over you in his expensive beige raincoat and kisses the ends of your hair. Ah, he kisses your hair.CLIENTS TO SEEBirthday snapshotsScotch tapeLetters to TD and MomTechnically, you are still a secretary for Karma-Kola, but you wear your Phi Beta Kappa key around your neck on a cheap gold chain, hoping someone will spot you for a promotion. Unfortunately, you have lost the respect of all but one of your co-workers and many of your superiors as well, who are working in order to send their daughters to universities so they won&#39;t have to be secretaries, and who, therefore, hold you in contempt for having a degree and being a failure anyway. It is like having a degree in failure. Hilda, however, likes you. You are young and remind her of her sister, the professional skater.&#34;But I hate to skate,&#34; you say.And Hilda smiles, nodding. &#34;Yup, that&#39;s exactly what my sister says sometimes and in that same way.&#34;What way?&#34;&#34;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&#34; says Hilda. &#34;Your bangs parted on the side or something.&#34;Ask Hilda if she will go to lunch with you. Over Reuben sandwiches ask her if she&#39;s ever had an affair with a married man. As she attempts, mid-bite, to complete the choreography of her chomp, Russian dressing spurts out onto her hands.&#34;Once,&#34; she says. &#34;That was the last lover I had. That was over two years ago.Say: &#34;Oh my god,&#34; as if it were horrible and tragic, then try to mitigate that rudeness by clearing your throat and saying, &#34;Well, actually, I guess that&#39;s not so bad.&#34;&#34;No,&#34; she sighs good-naturedly. &#34;His wife had Hodgkin&#39;s disease, or so everyone thought. When they came up with the correct diagnosis, something that wasn&#39;t nearly so awful, he went back to her. Does that make sense to you?&#34;&#34;I suppose,&#34; say doubtfully.&#34;Yeah, maybe you&#39;re right.&#34; Hilda is still cleaning Reuben off the backs of her hands with a napkin. &#34;At any rate, who are you involved with?&#34;&#34;Someone who has a wife that makes lists. She has Listmaker&#39;s disease.&#34;&#34;What are you going to do?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;&#34;Yeah,&#34; says Hilda. &#34;That&#39;s typical.&#34;CLIENTS TO SEETomatoes, cannedHealth food toothpasteHealth food deodorantVit.

Leave it lying around, conspicuously. Somehow you lose it. Make &#34;mislaid&#34; jokes to yourself. Make another list.Whisper, &#34;Don&#39;t go yet,&#34; as he glides out of your bed before sunrise and you lie there on your back cooling, naked between the sheets and smelling of musky, oniony sweat. Feel gray, like an abandoned locker room towel. Watch him as he again pulls on his pants, his sweater, his socks and shoes. Reach out and hold his thigh as he leans over and kisses you quickly, telling you not to get up, that he&#39;ll lock the door when he leaves. In the smoky darkness, you see him smile weakly, guiltily, and attempt a false, jaunty wave from the doorway. Turn on your side, toward the wall, so you don&#39;t have to watch the door close. You hear it thud nonetheless, the jangle of keys and snap of the bolt lock, the footsteps loud, then fading down the staircase, the clunk of the street door, then nothing, all his sounds blending with the city, his face passing namelessly uptown in a bus or a badly heated cab, the room, the whole building you live in, shuddering at the windows as a truck roars by toward the Queensboro Bridge.Wonder who you are.&#34;Hi, this is Attila,&#34; he says in a false deep voice when you pick up your office phone.Giggle. Like an idiot. Say: &#34;Oh. Hi, Hun.&#34;Hilda turns to look at you with a what&#39;s-with-you look on her face. Shrug your shoulders.&#34;Can you meet me for lunch?&#34;Say: &#34;Meet? I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t eat meat.&#34;Cute, you&#39;re cute,&#34; he says, not laughing, and at lunch he gives you his tomatoes.Drink two huge glasses of wine and smile at all his office and mother-in-law stories. It makes his eyes sparkle and crinkle at the corners, his face pleased and shining. When the waitress clears the plates away, there is a silence where the two of you look down then back up again.&#34;You get more beautiful every day,&#34; he says to you, as you hold your wine glass over your nose, burgundy rushing down your throat. Put your glass down. Redden. Smile. Fiddle with your Phi Beta Kappa key.When you get up to leave, take deep breaths. In front of the restaurant, where you will stride off in different directions, don&#39;t give him a kiss in the noontime throng. Patricia&#39;s office is nearby and she likes to go to the bank right around now; his back will stiffen and his eyes dart around like a crazy person&#39;s. Instead, do a quick shuffle-ball-chain like you saw Barbra Streisand do in a movie once. Wave gigantically and say: &#34;Till we eat again.&#34;In your office building the elevator is slow and packed and you forget to get off at the tenth floor and have to ride all the way back down again from the nineteenth. Five minutes after you arrive dizzily back at your desk, the phone rings.&#34;Meet me tomorrow at seven,&#34; he says, &#34;in front of Florsheim&#39;s and I&#39;ll carry you off to my castle. Patricia is going to a copyright convention.&#34;Wait freezing in front of Florsheim&#39;s until seven-twenty. He finally dashes up, gasping apologies (he just now got back from the airport), his coat flying open, and he takes you in tow quickly uptown toward the art museums. He lives near art museums. Ask him what a copyright convention is.&#34;Where leisure is a suit and a suite,&#34; he drawls, long and smiling, quickening his pace and yours. He kisses your temple, brushes hair off your face.You arrive at his building in twenty minutes.&#34;So, this is it?&#34; The castle doorman&#39;s fly is undone. Smile politely. In the elevator, say: &#34;The unexamined fly is not worth zipping.&#34;The elevator has a peculiar rattle, for all eight floors, like someone obsessively clearing her throat.When he finally gets the apartment door unlocked, he shows you into an L-shaped living room bursting with plants and gold-framed posters announcing exhibitions you are too late for by six years. The kitchen is off to one side--tiny, digital, spare, with a small army of chrome utensils hanging belligerent and clean as blades on the wall. Walk nervously around like a dog sniffing out the place. Peek into the bedroom: in the center, like a giant bloom, is a queen-sized bed with a Pennsylvania Dutch spread. A small photo of a woman in ski garb is propped on a nightstand. It frightens you.Back in the living room, he mixes drinks with Scotch in them. &#34;So, this is it,&#34; you say again with a forced grin and an odd heaving in your rib cage. Light up one of his cigarettes.&#34;Can I take your coat?&#34;Be strange and awkward. Say: &#34;I like beige. I think it is practical.&#34;&#34;What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34; he says, handing you your drink.Try to decide what you should do:1. rip open the front of your coat, sending the buttons torpedoing across the room in a series of pops into the asparagus fern;2. go into the bathroom and gargle with hot tap water;3. go downstairs and wave down a cab for home.He puts his mouth on your neck. Put your arms timidly around him. Whisper into his ear: &#34;There&#39;s a woman, uh, another woman in your room.When he is fast asleep upon you, in the middle of the night, send your left arm out slowly toward the nightstand like a mechanical limb programmed for a secret intelligence mission, and bring the ski garb picture back close to your face in the dark and try to study the features over his shoulder. She seems to have a pretty smile, short hair, no eyebrows, tough flaring nostrils, body indecipherably ensconced in nylon and down and wool.Slip carefully out, like a shoe horn, from beneath his sleeping body--he grunts groggily--and go to the closet. Open it with a minimum of squeaking and stare at her clothes. A few suits. Looks like beige blouses and a lot of brown things. Turn on the closet light. Look at the shoes. They are all lined up in neat, married pairs on the closet floor. Black pumps, blue sneakers, brown moccasins, brown T-straps. They have been to an expensive college, say, in Massachusetts. Gaze into her shoes. Her feet are much larger than yours. They are like small cruise missiles.Inside the caves of those shoes, eyes form and open their lids, stare up at you, regard you, wink at you from the insoles. They are half-friendly, conspiratorial, amused at this reconnaissance of yours, like little smiling men from the open hatches of a fleet of military submarines. Turn off the light and shut the door quickly, before they start talking or dancing or something. Scurry back to the bed and hide your face in his armpit.</p><h2>Reilly&#39;s luck</h2><p>Reilly&#39;s Luck is one of L&#39;Amour&#39;s longest books of the period, and is the best. Read it.

Judge Armando Acosta is busted for soliciting an undercover vice operative; perhaps not coincidentally, the autocratic judge currently is in charge of a grand jury probing possible police cover-up of murder. Complications immediately pile up. Assistant DA Lenore Goya, whom Paul hankers after, is fired by DA Coleman Kline and crosses lines to head up Acosta's defense; Coleman pursues the judge with unexpected ferocity. Then Lenore's fingerprint is found at the murder scene and she's forced off the case, in effect forcing Paul, who has suffered courtroom run-ins with Acosta, to step in. Nearly all the subsequent action takes place in court or offices as we follow the intricacies of the trial, including rollercoaster swoops through jury selection, evidence and testimony. Paul, who narrates in the present tense, as he has other Martini novels, once again proves a sophisticated, good-humored hero who tells a suspenseful tale, right up to the perfectly satisfying climax. Even the loose ends he trails behind feel right. Legal thrillers don't get much better than this.

Meze, the small plates of just about everything from seafood, meat, and vegetables to handheld pies, colorful salads, nuts, olives, and cheeses, is the food of hospitality and conviviality, food meant to be shared with friends and family and savored with wines and spirits.</p><p>Here, in <em>Meze</em>, Diane Kochilas, the award-winning author of <em>The Glorious Foods of Greece</em>, chef, restaurateur, and cooking teacher, takes you on a spirited journey across Greece and the rest of the Mediterranean, exploring these simple and simply irresistible dishes. The recipes are robust, dear, and easy to follow. These uncomplicated dishes are charged with flavor and based on fresh, accessible ingredients. The results are spectacular.</p><p>Meze makes every meal a party, and no one knows how to throw a party better than the Greeks. Youll find tangy, skewered meats and juicy meatballs, delicious seafood dishes from simple steamed mussels to creamy ouzo-flavored shrimp. You'll find a healthful selection of aromatic bean dishes, and a recipe for the best fried potatoes in the world, Greek fries, which are hand cut and cooked in olive oil.</p><p>The convivial and festive nature of the meze table is reflected in Diane's warm, inviting style. The innate attractiveness of the food -- the colors, textures, and shapes -- are captured in brilliant photographs that evoke the sunny, warm Mediterranean dime. Whether you make just a few dishes for informal entertaining, or create an entire meal of meze, Diane Kochilas makes it possible to bring the spirit of fun and sharingthe essence of meze throughout Greece and the Mediterranean -- to your own table at home.</p></p><p>To confuse meze with antipasto or tapas is to miss the point. These small plates of Greek deliciousness come to us from a Mediterranean world of mid-afternoon snacking, drinking, and talking. The pace is leisurely, the content simple, the effect extraordinary. Early on in <i>Meze</i> Diane Kochilas, award-winning author of <i>The Glorious Foods of Greece</i>, sets the prototypic meze stage: two village codgers holding down either side of a small table; two glasses and a carafe of <i>raki</i> between them; a plate with some bread, olives, air-dried anchovies, cucumber sticks, and cheese. They do not sit at the table so much as beside the table, the better to take in the world. <p> </p><p> And thus it is with meze. It's not about sitting down to eat as much as being present to exchange ideas, enjoy a glass of wine or spirits, and snack on taste treats that enliven the palate and pull all the threads of the whole into one. Kochilas divides <i>Meze</i> into "Dips, Spreads, and Relishes"; "Savory Salads"; "Small Egg Dishes"; "Phyllo Pies"; "Finger Foods and Fried Treats"; "Vegetable and Bean Mezethes"; "A Sea's Bounty"; "From Meatballs to Kebabs"; and, the "Meze Pantry." She provides sources for ingredients. And she includes enlightening notes on Greek wine and spirits, perfect for serving with these small dishes. She is truly a master of it all and a delight to read. When was the last time you mixed garlicky yogurt with dried apricots, or baked figs with oregano? Put your hand in Kochilas's oven mitt. She'll take you to a new, delicious, life-invigorating territory. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><p>The author of five cookbooks, including <em>Meze</em> and the IACP Award-winning <em>The Glorious Foods of Greece</em>, Diane Kochilas writes for <em>Saveur</em>, <em>Gourmet</em>, and the <em>New York Times</em>; runs the Glorious Greek Kitchen Cooking School on the Greek island of Ikaria; is the consulting chef at Pylos, an acclaimed Greek restaurant in New York City; and is the food columnist and restaurant critic for <em>Ta Nea</em>, the largest-circulation daily newspaper in Greece.

Wearing a wide-brimmed hat, carrying a parasol, and shunning the sun are good ideas. Anything to avoid the terrible pain, itching, and swelling of a sunburn.<br><br>If you found yourself outside without your trusty parasol and came away with a nasty sunburn, heed this advice from the experts.<br><br>Apply soothing compresses. Following a burn, the skin is inflamed. Cool it down with compresses dipped in any one of the following substances. If desired, you can direct a fan on the sunburned area to heighten cooling.<br><br>Cold water: Use either plain water from the faucet or add a few ice cubes, says Michael Schreiber, M.D. Dip a cloth into the liquid and lay it over the burn. Repeat every few minutes as the cloth warms. Apply several times a day for a total of 10 to 15 minutes each.<br><br>Aluminum acetate. If itching is intense, says Thomas Gossel, Ph.D., R.Ph., try mixing Domeboro's powder packets (available in drugstores) with water. The aluminum acetate in the powder keeps skin from getting too dry or itchy. Follow package directions.<br><br>Witch hazel. Moisten a cloth with witch hazel, says Fredric Haberman, M.D. This incredible astringent has been shown to have long-lasting anti-inflammatory relief. Apply often for temporary relief. For smaller areas, dip cotton balls into the liquid and gently stroke on.<br><br>Soak the pain away. An alternative to compresses, especially for larger areas, is a cool bath. Add more liquid as needed to keep the water at the proper temperature. Afterward, gently pat your skin dry with a clean towel. Do not rub you skin, or you'll irritate it further. The following substances can reduce pain, itching, and inflammation.<br><br>Vinegar: Mix 1 cup of white or apple cider vinegar into a tub of cool water, says Carl Korn, M.D. A great astringent, it soothes sunburn pain.<br><br>Aveeno powder. If the sunburn involves a large area, use the premeasured packets or add 1/2 cup of Aveeno Bath Treatment, made from oatmeal, to a tub of cool water, says Dr. Schreiber. Soak for 15 to 20 minutes. Aveeno is a well-known remedy for itching.<br><br>Baking Soda. Generously sprinkle baking soda into tepid bath water, suggests Dr. Haberman. Instead of toweling off, let the solution dry on your skin. It is completely nontoxic, and it will soothe the pain.<br><br>Go easy on soap. Soap can dry and irritate burned skin. If you must use soap, says Dr. Gossel, use only a mild brand and rinse it off very well. Do not soak in soapy water. Likewise, stay away from bubble baths.<br><br>Moisturize your skin. Soaks and compresses feel good and give temporary relief, says Rodney Basler, M.D. But they can make your skin feel drier than before if you don't apply moisturizer immediately afterward. Pat yourself dry, then smooth on some bath oil.<br><br>Let it soak in for a minute, then apply a moisturizing cream or lotion, such as Eucerin. Some people like a topical cream called Wibi, which contains a little bit of cooling menthol.<br><br>Chill out. For added relief, try chilling your moisturizer before applying it.<br><br>Seek hydrocortisone relief. Soothe skin irritation and inflammation with a topical lotion, spray, or ointment containing 1 percent hydrocortisone, such as Cortaid or Cortizone-10 says Dr. Basler.<br><br>Say goodbye with aloe. "We're starting to see evidence in medical literature that aloe vera may really help wound healing," says Dr. Basler. Simply break off a leaf and apply the juice. But test a small area first, he cautions, to make sure you're not allergic to aloe.<br><br>Guard against infection. If you have an infection or are worried that one will develop, use an over-the-counter antibacterial ointment such as Polysporin or Neosporin, says Dr. Schreiber.<br><br>Try a local anesthetic. If your burn is mild, an over-the-counter anesthetic can relieve pain and itching, says Dr. Gossel. Look for brands that contain benzocaine, benzyl alcohol, lidocaine, or diphenhydramine hydrochloride. Aerosols are easier to apply than creams or ointments, but never spray them directly onto your face. Instead, put some on a piece of gauze or a cotton pad and pat in on your face to avoid contact with your eyes.<br><br>Try an ice pack. An ice pack can also provide relief if the burn is mild. Wrap it in a damp cloth and hold it over the sunburn. Improvise, if necessary, says Dr. Haberman. "You could even take a bag of frozen peas, for instance, and use that. But make sure to wrap it first so that you're not placing the icy package directly against your skin.."<br><br>Drink up. It's a good idea to drink lots of water to help counteract the drying effects of a sunburn, says Dr. Gossel.<br><br>Eat right. Eat lightly but wisely, Dr. Gossel adds. A balanced diet helps provide the nutrients your skin needs to regenerate itself.<br><br>Raise your legs. If you legs are burned and you feet are swollen, elevate your legs above heart level to help stop the swelling, says Dr. Basler.<br><br>Get a good night's rest. Sleeping on a sunburn can be challenging, but you need rest for your body to recover from the burn. Try sprinkling talcum powder on your sheets to minimize chafing and friction, says Dr. Haberman. A waterbed or air mattress might also help you sleep more easily.<br><br>Be careful with blisters. If blisters develop, you have a pretty bad burn. If they bother you and they cover only a small area, you may carefully drain them, says Dr. Basler. But do not peel the top skin off--you'll have less discomfort and danger of infection if air does not come in contact with sensitive nerve endings.<br><br>To drain the fluid, first sterilize a needle by holding it over a flame. Then puncture the edge of the blister and press gently on the top to let the fluid come out. Do this three times in the first 24 hours, says Dr. Basler. Then leave the blisters alone.<br><br>Beware ice and snow. Don't let your guard down in winter, says Butch Farabee, former assistant superintendent of Montana's Glacier National Park. You can get a fierce burn from the sun's rays reflected off ice and snow. "I've even gotten the inside of my mouth sunburned when hiking up icy hills because I was breathing so hard that my mouth was open," he says. So cover up appropriately and wear sunscreen on all exposed areas.<br><br>Don't make the same mistake twice. After you've gotten burned, it takes 3 to 6 months for your skin to return to normal, says Dr. Schreiber. "When you get a sunburn and the top layer of skin peels off, the newly exposed skin is more sensitive than ever. That means you'll burn even faster than you did before if you're not careful."<br><br>WHEN TO CALL A DOCTOR<br><br>A severe burn can take a lot out of you, says Rodney Basler, M.D. Consult a doctor if you experience nausea, chills, fever, faintness, extensive blistering, general weakness, patches of purple discoloration, or intense itching. Be aware that if the burn seems to be spreading, you could have an infection compounding the problem.<br><br>Do just 1 thing<br><br>Take some aspirin. This old standby can help relieve the pain, itching, and swelling of a mild to moderate burn. "Take two tablets every 4 hours," says Rodney Basler, M.D. The same dosage of Tylenol also would work. Or, if your stomach can tolerate it, you might try ibuprofen every 8 hours. Follow label instructions for dosages.<br><br>If you know you've gotten too much sun, try taking aspirin before the redness appears. "Some doctors recommend 650 milligrams of aspirin soon after sun exposure. Repeat every 4 hours for up to six doses," says Thomas Gossel, Ph.D., R.Ph.<br><br>Cures from the Kitchen<br><br>Common kitchen staples can be great sunburn soothers. Press the following into emergency action.<br><br>Oatmeal. Wrap dry oatmeal in cheesecloth or gauze. Run cool water through it. Discard the oatmeal and soak compresses in the liquid. Apply every 2 to 4 hours.<br><br>Fat-free milk. Mix 1 cup fat-free milk with 4 cups water, then add a few ice cubes. Apply compresses for 15 to 20 minutes; repeat every 2 to 4 hours.<br><br>Cornstarch. Add enough water to cornstarch to make a paste. Apply directly to the sunburn.<br><br>Lettuce. Boil lettuce leaves in water. Strain, then let the liquid cool several hours in the refrigerator. Dip cotton balls into the liquid and gently press or stroke onto irritated skin.<br><br>Yogurt. Apply yogurt to all sunburned areas. Rinse off in a cool shower, then gently pat skin dry.<br><br>Tea bags. If your eyelids are burned, apply tea bags soaked in cool water to decrease swelling and help relieve pain. Tea has tannic acid, which seems to ease sunburn pain.</p><h2>Apocalyptic Planet: Field Guide to the Everending Earth</h2><p><p>The earth has died many times, and it always comes back looking different. In an exhilarating, surprising exploration of our planet, Craig Childs takes readers on a firsthand journey through apocalypse, touching the truth behind the speculation. <i>Apocalyptic Planet</i> is a combination of science and adventure that reveals the ways in which our world is constantly moving toward its end and how we can change our place within the cycles and episodes that rule it.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this riveting narrative, Childs makes clear that ours is not a stable planet, that it is prone to sudden, violent natural disasters and extremes of climate. Alternate futures, many not so pretty, are constantly waiting in the wings. Childs refutes the idea of an apocalyptic end to the earth and finds clues to its more inevitable end in some of the most physically challenging places on the globe. He travels from the deserts of Chile, the driest in the world, to the genetic wasteland of central Iowa to the site of the drowned land bridge of the Bering Sea, uncovering the micro-cataclysms that predict the macro: forthcoming ice ages, super-volcanoes, and the conclusion of planetary life cycles. Childs delivers a sensual feast in his descriptions of the natural world and a bounty of unequivocal science that provides us with an unprecedented understanding of our future.</p></p><p><p><b>Guest Review for Apocalyptic Planet from Neil Shubin</b></p> <p><strong>Neil Shubin is author of <em>Your Inner Fish</em> and the upcoming <em>The Universe Within</em>. He is provost of The Field Museum as well as professor of anatomy at the University of Chicago, where he also serves as an associate dean.

In glacial ice, rocky mountains, and dusty outcroppings on the desert floor, Craig Childs uses cutting-edge science to reveal the dazzling changes our planet has experienced. Seas have come and gone; mountains have risen only to fall; while whole continents have moved, split, and crashed into one another. The 4.67-billion-year-history of Earth has seen whole worlds collapse, with others born in their remains. Planetary apocalypse is the way of the world; our very presence on the planet has been shaped by cataclysm.</p> <p>Craig Childs walking on the desert or climbing a mountain is like a gourmand at a sumptuous feast: the sensual delight with which he relishes the world around him gives the rest of us a vicarious thrill, even hunger. You just want to turn over that rock he sees, move dust to expose an ancient artifact, or scale the cave wall in front of him. Childs delights in the details of the rock, sand, and ice, and in them he finds stories as large as the planet itself. In his hands, the main casualty of apocalypse is our familiar view of Earth: it is impossible to read Craig Childs and see the world in the same way again.</p> <p><b>A Look Inside <em>Apocalyptic Planet</em></b></p> <em> </em> <em> </em> <em> </em><p><b>Craig Childs</b> is a commentator for NPR&#x2019;s <i>Morning Edition,</i> and his work has appeared in <i>The New York Times,</i> the <i>Los Angeles Times, Men&#x2019;s Journal, Outside, The Sun,</i> and <i>Orion.</i> Awards he has won include the Ellen Meloy Desert Writers Award, the Rowell Award for the Art of Adventure, the Sigurd F.

Although that statement is perhaps the most common cliche in the literature of the game, it is too often misunderstood.<br><br>Pawns are usually considered weak because of their limited range of movement. But the pawns' restricted mobility is precisely what makes them so important strategically: they form a semi-permanent structure -- often called a "pawn skeleton" -- that establishes the territorial lines of the coming battle and thus the nature of the battle itself. Understanding how pawns affect strategy is the subject of this important book. In it you will learn:<br>-- how to handle the characteristic pawn structure of each opening "family" and each major variation<br>-- how to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of pawn chains<br>-- when to exchange pawns in the center -- and when not to<br>-- how to cramp your opponent's position and what to do if your opponent cramps yours<br>-- how to create and exploit pawn "holes"...and much, much more, all copiously illustrated by complete games from actual play.</p><p>Andrew Soltis is a grandmaster and a chess columnist for New York Post and Chess Life.

IT streamed down his forehead, collected in his eyebrows, and dripped from the end of his nose. Every few minutes he stopped digging and wiped his brow with the back of his hand. It did not do much good. Seconds later, the perspiration was flowing as freely as before.A few miles away, in Lynchburg, the weather bureau&#x2019;s protected thermometer was pushing eighty-four. But it was hotter than that in the shadeless garden where Derek and his wife, Nancy, had been working since early that morning. It was much too hot, Derek thought, for March 30. Without turning his head, he asked his wife, &#x201c;How are you holding up?&#x201d;&#x201c;As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, we can call it a day,&#x201d; Nancy replied wearily.&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good idea,&#x201d; Derek agreed, slowly straightening his stiffening back. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s sundowner time.&#x201d;Normally, it does not get particularly warm in the Blue Ridge Mountain country of central Virginia until much later in the year. But 1985 was an exception; the sun had been beating down relentlessly all week. It was particularly hard on Derek, who was accustomed to cooler climes.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be just as miserable tomorrow as it was today,&#x201d; he grumbled as he gathered his tools and began stacking them at the side of the house. Sometimes he was as fussy as an old maid, which is about what one might expect from a man whose favorite hobby, after gardening and card games, was designing circuit boards for ham radios. &#x201c;But that doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; he panted. &#x201c;Palm Sunday or no, we&#x2019;re going to have to be out early again.&#x201d;Nancy nodded silently in agreement, too exhausted to reply. Turning toward the house, she listlessly peeled off her thick cotton gloves and threw them on the ground.As he gathered the equipment, Derek tried to make light of his fatigue, joking about his &#x201c;seventy-two-year-old bones&#x201d; and how it was getting harder to bounce back than it used to be. Advancing age was not something he accepted readily. To help postpone it, he kept in shape with tennis and sporadic jogs along Holcomb Rock Road, the narrow, twisting thoroughfare that ran in front of their house. But a long day of hard labor in a hot sun was enough to drain even the barrel-chested Derek.The Haysoms had moved to Boonsboro three years before, in 1982, after Derek retired as director of a venture capital organization in Nova Scotia. An engineer by education and training, Derek had shifted into management at midcareer and worked in executive jobs on three continents. Boonsboro beckoned because it was a suburb of Lynchburg, where Nancy had grown up. They lived in relative tranquility in a modest two-story house that Nancy had named Loose Chippings, after a dwelling in an obscure British novel. In the novel, the house was called that because it served as a sort of way station for eccentrics. Nancy found that particularly applicable to their situation.Naming houses was one of Nancy&#x2019;s little quirks. Another was collecting small boulders, which she used for building walls around the gardens they always planted whenever they moved to a new residence. Over the twenty-five years she and Derek had been married, wherever they lived, Nancy always built rock walls around their gardens. Now that she was into middle age, the children nagged her about it. Wrestling with outsized rocks, they argued, was not a hobby particularly conducive to her continued good health. To appease them, she promised that the wall at Loose Chippings would be her last.&#x201c;I&#x2019;m for a shower,&#x201d; she said, running her hand through a mop of auburn hair that was just beginning to show streaks of gray.&#x201c;You go ahead,&#x201d; Derek muttered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll finish up here and then I&#x2019;ll be right behind you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;GOD, IT WAS BEASTLY OUT TODAY,&#x201d; NANCY SAID, LOOKING cool and comfortable in a royal blue dashiki she had chosen for a quiet evening at home. Her speech was clipped and sprinkled with Briticisms, which was not surprising considering she had spent the last thirty-six years, since she was seventeen, living among British expatriates in southern Africa and Canada. Despite her Virginia roots, there was hardly a hint of a southern drawl.&#x201c;Summer will be here before we know it,&#x201d; agreed Derek. &#x201c;At times like this I wish we were back in Nova Scotia.&#x201d;While Nancy&#x2019;s accent was affected, Derek&#x2019;s was legitimate. Most Americans hearing him talk, in fact, thought he was British. In reality, he was a South African of British descent, a native of Natal Province on the East Coast. During the years he worked and studied in the United Kingdom before returning to southern Africa after World War II, he polished his speech to the point where no one but an Englishman would notice his colonial roots.Nancy sighed. Finishing her drink, she extended her empty glass. &#x201c;Would you, please?&#x201d; she asked Derek.Derek took it and strode to the liquor cabinet. &#x201c;The same?&#x201d; he asked, already pouring a large shot of gin over the melting cubes.She did not answer. Given a choice, Nancy almost always drank gin: Boodles when it was available, Gordon&#x2019;s when it was not. It was a sign of his exhaustion that Derek did not offer his usual lecture on the evils of her beverage of choice. Almost invariably he chided her about her love for gin. &#x201c;The juniper extract used to flavor it is a perfect poison,&#x201d; he would say. &#x201c;It produces the same feelings of aggression as amphetamines.&#x201d; Tonight he said nothing. Silently, he added a splash of soda and a slice of lemon to her glass and put it to the side while he refilled his own. Derek&#x2019;s preference was scotch, which he consumed in the British fashion: straight up&#x2014;no ice, no water, no soda.Scooping up the two glasses, he recrossed the room, handing the gin to Nancy and taking a seat across from her. As much out of habit as because of the heat, Derek had closed all the curtains so that they were sitting in the glow of a single lamp. The weak light threw Derek&#x2019;s craggy face into strong shadow, accentuating his nose and jutting chin, making him look positively fierce. The same light made Nancy appear soft and cuddly. At fifty-three she was still a good-looking woman, perky rather than pretty, petite with attractive, even features, a charming upturned nose, flashing brown eyes, and a fine, full figure. Plump some might say. But whenever she and Derek attended social functions, and that was often, Nancy never failed to draw stares from the men in the group. This raised conflicting emotions in Derek &#x2014;pride mixed with jealousy&#x2014;and usually sent him off on a tirade about how she undoubtedly would remarry quickly once he was out of the way. She laughed off those exhibitions, but as a woman with an almost insatiable need for attention and affection, she was secretly pleased with her lingering voluptuousness. Tonight, she had not bothered with makeup after her shower, and the lamplight made her appear unnaturally pale. Around her neck was a doublestranded gold choker, her only concession to formality for the evening. It glowed in the darkness.&#x201c;One more, please, dear,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A little something while I&#x2019;m fixing dinner.&#x201d;While Derek mixed her another drink, Nancy put a pot of rice on to boil and attacked a mound of ground beef, shaping the meat into thick patties, which she slid into the oven.<br>&nbsp;NANCY RINSED THE PLATES AND STACKED THEM IN THE dishwasher, carefully culling the silverware because she always washed that by hand. In the dining room, Derek slumped peacefully at the table, enjoying the after-dinner quiet. It had been a long day, and he was falling victim to too much sun, too much scotch, and too much dinner. He was just about to nod off when there was a loud rapping at the door. He jerked upright. &#x201c;Bloody hell,&#x201d; he cursed, blinking and squinting at his watch. It was just past eight o&#x2019;clock.&#x201c;Are you expecting anyone?&#x201d; Nancy called from the kitchen.&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Derek grumbled, stretching like an old dog forced to surrender his favorite napping spot.Nancy poked her head through the serving door cut into the wall between the kitchen and dining room. &#x201c;I wonder who it might be?&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll soon find out,&#x201d; replied Derek. Carefully placing his palms flat on the sturdy table, he used his powerful arms and shoulders to push himself upright. As he moved his chair back, it scraped across the slate floor like a fingernail being dragged down a chalkboard.&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming,&#x201d; he yelled, setting off unsteadily across the room. After his shower Derek had changed into a pair of baggy work pants and a short-sleeved shirt, which was marked by dark half-circles under the arms. On his feet was a pair of new Indian-style moccasins, the kind in which the sole wraps around the foot to be joined to the upper by thick laces. As he walked, the leather made soft scuffling sounds on the uneven stone, the kind of soft whisking noise the barber used to make when he stropped his straight razor. The scotch had thrown Derek&#x2019;s internal compass askew, and he walked lopsidedly to the door.Nancy left the kitchen and crossed the dining room, silently watching her husband&#x2019;s erratic progress toward the door. She was more curious than anxious. Not many people arrived unannounced on a Saturday night, and she was eager to see who it was. Unconsciously, she brought her left hand to her breast and gathered the dashiki more tightly about her. Underneath the robe she wore only a beige bra and matching panties, not exactly the attire she would have preferred for welcoming guests.Derek paused at the door, fumbling with the light switches. The visitor thumped the knocker again. &#x201c;All <i>right,&#x201d;</i> Derek growled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so bloody impatient.&#x201d; With his right hand, he flipped the switch closest to him, turning on a set of floodlights that bathed the top half of the driveway in harsh light. Clearly visible was the Haysoms&#x2019; creaky ten-year-old tan van, which Nancy had joshingly christened the Bronze Belle. To its right was their 1963 BMW sedan. Immediately in front of the door, side-by-side with the Belle, was a shiny new silver-blue subcompact that Derek had never seen before.Reaching up, Derek flipped a second switch. It controlled a single bulb over the doorway, and when it was lit, it threw heavy shadows on whomever happened to be standing on the stoop. Sometimes, depending on how close the caller was to the door, visual identification was tricky. But a nearly full moon eliminated that problem. Although he did not know the car, Derek immediately recognized the caller.&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; he said in surprise. &#x201c;What are <i>you</i> doing here?&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2014;&#x201d; the visitor started, but he stopped when Nancy&#x2019;s head appeared over Derek&#x2019;s shoulder, a puzzled look on her face.&#x201c;Is Elizabeth with you?&#x201d; Nancy asked, peering into the darkness to see if she could see her daughter walking up the path.&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the visitor replied. &#x201c;I came alone.&#x201d; He was wearing jeans and, despite the warm night, a gray Members Only windbreaker. It effectively hid the layer of baby fat that still clung to his five-foot-eight frame. He wore thick-lensed spectacles and offered a tentative smile.&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this all about?&#x201d; Derek demanded in the gruff manner he used with those he did not particularly like. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;&#x201c;Is anything the matter?&#x201d; Nancy interjected. &#x201c;Is Elizabeth all right?&#x201d;&#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; the visitor said, shuffling nervously from foot to foot, bouncing in his white running shoes like a marathoner waiting for the starting gun. &#x201c;I came because I wanted to talk to you and your husband.&#x201d;Derek frowned. &#x201c;Talk to us? What about? Why isn&#x2019;t Lizzie with you?&#x201d; His tone was more than mildly belligerent.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, Derek,&#x201d; Nancy said soothingly. Despite her gin-induced fog she felt the visitor&#x2019;s tension. It was palpable, as obvious as the darkness and the heat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s a good reason,&#x201d; she whispered, laying a calming hand on her husband&#x2019;s forearm.Turning to the visitor, she flashed an airline hostess smile. &#x201c;Please come in,&#x201d; she said, trying to project a warmth she did not feel. &#x201c;We were just finishing dinner. Come in, and I&#x2019;ll fix you a plate.&#x201d;Copyright � 1990 by Ken Englade.</p><h2>Intermediate Studies in Alchemy : Alchemical Formulas for Self-Mastery</h2><p>Voltaire, in a letter to Frederick II, referred to him as &#34;a man who never dies, and who knows everything.&#34; Saint Germain is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating personalities of recorded history. The activities of this illustrious master have been documented for more than a century (1710 - 1822) throughout the courts of Europe. To the peoples of many lands Saint Germain was considered a citizen, for he spoke twelve languages with the fluency of a native. Composing and improvising on the piano without music and playing the violin &#34;like an orchestra&#34; or but a few of the achievements that demonstrate the stunning genius of the &#34;Wonderman of Europe.&#34; To remove the false from precious gems was a simple task for the master alchemist. Neither was beyond his ability to transmute base metals into gold. According to the confidence in the court of Louis XV, Madame Pompadour, he possessed a miraculous elixir that could prolong life. Aside from the prodigious, Saint Germain&#39;s strongest attribute is his devotion to the freedom and enlightenment of all mankind. His never-ending service to life will stand as a tribute to this distinguished master for generations to come. In Intermediate Studies in Alchemy, Saint Germain introduces the alchemical formulas for self-mastery. Through the applied study of this science, you can climb the levels of higher consciousness. You can learn to control the elements that affect your life and the lives of those around you.</p><p></p><h2>Sarah Sze (Phaidon Contemporary Artists Series)</h2><p><p><strong>The first substantial monograph on an artist whose sculptures capture the proliferation of information and objects in contemporary life.</strong></p><p>Sarah Sze (b. Boston, 1969, lives and works in New York) has developed a sculptural aesthetic that transforms space through radical shifts in scale, colonizing peripheral spaces, engaging with the history of a building, and altering the viewer's perception and experience of architecture through large, site-specific interventions. Known for her unexpected and carefully arranged combinations of materials, from cotton buds and tea bags to water bottles and ladders, light bulbs and electric fans, Sze has presented ephemeral installations that penetrate walls, suspend from ceilings and burrow into the ground. Her work exists at the intersection of sculpture, drawing and architecture where her formal interest in light, air and movement is coupled with an intuitive understanding of colour and texture.</p><p>Like the scientific instruments of measurement they often reference, Sze's sculptures attempt to quantify and organize the universe, ascribing a fragile, personal system of order. Within her practice, sculpture becomes both a device for organizing and dismantling information and a mechanism to locate and dislocate oneself in time and space.</p><p>Sze received a BA from Yale University in Connecticut in 1991 and an MFA from New York's School of Visual Arts in 1997. She is represented by Tanya Bonakdar in New York and Victoria Miro in London. In 2013 she represented the United States at the 55th Venice Biennale. She was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellows Program Genius Grant in 2003 and of the AICA Award for Best Project in a Public Space in 2012.</p><p>Her work is well represented in important private and public collections worldwide, including those of New York's Guggenheim Museum, Museum of Modern Art, New Museum, and Whitney Museum of American Art, along with the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, 21st Century Museum of Art in Kanazawa, Japan, Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Boston Museum of Fine Arts, High Museum of Art in Atlanta, GA, and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.</p></p><p><p>Benjamin H.

In that sense they are everything a sculpture can and should hope to be." &#x2014;Nick Compton, <em>Wallpaper</em></p><p>"Sze's work routinely refuses the viewer the safety of a single viewpoint.

In dealing with believers&#39; suffering from spiritual depression, Bridge manifests great insight into the causes of the saints&#39; discouragements such as great sins, weak grace, failure in duties, want of assurance, temptation, desertion and affliction. A correct diagnosis is more than half the cure but Bridge does not leave his readers there. He gives directions for applying the remedy. For example in dealing with &#39;great sins&#39; he says, &#39;If you would be truly humbled and not be discouraged; not be discouraged and yet be humbled; then beat and drive up all your sin to your unbelief, and lay the stress and weight of all your sorrow upon that sin. The general causes of spiritual depression are the same in every age. Downcast Christians of the twenty-first century can find help here as surely as did past generations.</p><p>Born in Cambridgeshire around 1600, William Bridge entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1619, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1623 and a master's degree in 1626, before serving as a fellow at the college.<br><br>He was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1627, and served in Saffron Walden and Colchester in Essex, then becoming rector of St. Peter Hungate in Norwich in 1632.<br><br>In 1636 he was forced to flee to Rotterdam in Holland, because of Bishop Matthew Wren's campaign against nonconformity, and co-pastored a church there with John Ward and then Jeremiah Burroughs.<br><br>Returning to England in 1641, the following year he was appointed a member of the Westminster Assembly, and proved himself a noted Independent.

Reprint.</p><p>After her first appearance in Too Many Crooks Spoil the Broth, dowdy Mennonite innkeeper Magdalena Yoder, 44, remains chaste and abstemious, and still in possession of her keen mind and sharp tongue, which she unleashes upon some Hollywood sleazoids shooting a movie at her country inn, the PennDutch. The murder of an assistant director, whose body is found pinned to a barn post by a pitchfork, shocks everyone. When numbskull local police chief Melvin Stoltzfus suspects Magdalena, the shrewd lady begins to clear her name by interviewing some of the more likely suspects in the nearby town of Hernia, Penn., (pop. 1528). The strength?and the weakness?of this tale is the acid-tongued voice of the heroine, who demonstrates her quick wit at the expense of others (including, here, a star-struck preacher's wife and her own promiscuous sister). But Myers bets too much on the entertainment value of Magdalena's zingers, which, like the heavy-handed contrast between Hollywood trendiness and stolid country values, become tedious. Buoying interest are recipes from the PennDutch kitchen, a sizzling scene in a six-seat outhouse and an impending romance for Magdalena. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Opinionated, irreverent, and often rude, Magdalena Yoder (Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth, LJ 1/1/94) again trades her successful innkeeper status for that of persistent amateur sleuth. Having negotiated an exorbitant sum from a movie company for the use of her famous PennDutch Inn, she then endures obnoxious local hopefuls, argumentative directors, changeable scripts, and, finally, murder. The doltish local police chief blames Magdalena. As a result, she runs to her own defense. Weird characters and a few good recipes accompany the quirky plot, but the key to enjoying this work is to appreciate its exaggerated humor.

Practical advice, such as making reservations, goes hand-in-hand with colorful descriptions of the Italian <i>ristorante</i>, <i>trattoria</i>, <i>pizzeria</i>, <i>friggitoria</i>, and other types of eating establishments. Plotkin is particularly adept at depicting the cultural climate of each region, listing appealing towns a traveler must not pass by and those area culinary specialities to be savored. Whether one desires the address of a fine butcher shop, has a hankering for pastries and an espresso, or seeks a dining experience fit for a king, these listings more than fit the bill. When seeking out excellent culinary fare, doubtless, the true gourmet will be undaunted by this weighty tome. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>Caroline&#39;s Battle (American Girl: Caroline&#39;s Stories, 5)</h2><p>Caroline's father has just returned when they receive frightening news--British warships are sailing to attack Sackets Harbor.

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, in which the hobbit Frodo and his elfish friends get swept up in a mighty conflict with the dark lord Sauron (who owes much to proud Satan in <i>Paradise Lost</i>), the monstrous Gollum, the Cracks of Doom, and the awful power of the magical Ring. The book's characters--good and evil--are recognizably human, and the realism is deepened by the magnificent detail of the vast parallel world Tolkien devised, inspired partly by his influential Anglo-Saxon scholarship and his Christian beliefs. (He disapproved of the relative sparseness of detail in the comparable allegorical fantasy his friend C.S. Lewis dreamed up in the Chronicles of Narnia, though he knew Lewis had spun a page-turning yarn.) It has been estimated that one-tenth of all paperbacks sold can trace their ancestry to J.R.R. Tolkien. But even if we had never gotten Robert Jordan's <i>The Path of Daggers</i> and the whole fantasy genre Tolkien inadvertently created by bringing the hobbits so richly to life, Tolkien's epic about the Ring would have left our world enhanced by enchantment. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Includes the 50th anniversary fully corrected text setting and an extensive new index"An extraordinary work -- pure excitement." -- <i>New York Times Book Review</i>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them <br>In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others.

For the British there, life is orderly and genteel. Then the sepoys at the nearest military cantonment rise in revolt and the British community retreats with shock into the Residency. They prepare to fight for their lives with what weapons they can muster. As food and ammunition grow short, the Residency, its defences battered by shot and shell and eroded by the rains, becomes ever more vulnerable.</p><p><i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i>is a modern classic of narrative excitement that also digs deep to explore some fundamental questions of civilisation and life.</p><p><strong>'Suspense and subtlety, humour and horror, the near-neighbourliness of heroism and insanity: it is rare to find such divergent elements being controlled in one hand and being raced, as it were, in one yoke. But Farrell manages just this here: his imaginative insight and technical virtuosity combine to produce a novel of quite outstanding quality'<i>The Times</i></strong><strong></strong><br><strong></strong><br><strong>'The magnificient passages of action in<i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i>, its gallery of characters, its unashamedly detailed and fascinating dissertations on cholera, gunnery, phrenology, the prodigal inventiveness of its no doubt also well-documented scenes should satisfy the most exacting and voracious reader. For a novel to be witty is one thing, to tell a good story is another, to be serious is yet another, but to be all three is surely enough to make it a masterpiece' John Spurling,<i>New Statesman</i></strong></p></p><p><i>"The first sign of trouble at Krishnapur came with a mysterious distribution of chapatis, made of coarse flour and about the size and thickness of a biscuit; towards the end of February 1857, they swept the countryside like an epidemic."</i> <p> Students of history will recognize 1857 as the year of the Sepoy rebellion in India--an uprising of native soldiers against the British, brought on by Hindu and Muslim recruits' belief that the rifle cartridges they were provided had been greased with pig or cow fat. This seminal event in Anglo-Indian relations provides the backdrop for J.G. Farrell's Booker Prize-winning exploration of race, culture, and class, <i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i>. </p><p> Like the mysteriously appearing chapatis, life in British India seems, on the surface, innocuous enough. Farrell introduces us gradually to a large cast of characters as he paints a vivid portrait of the Victorians' daily routines that are accompanied by heat, boredom, class consciousness, and the pursuit of genteel pastimes intended for cooler climates. Even the siege begins slowly, with disquieting news of massacres in cities far away. When Krishnapur itself is finally attacked, the Europeans withdraw inside the grounds of the Residency where very soon conditions begin to deteriorate: food and water run out, disease is rampant, people begin to go a little mad. Soon the very proper British are reduced to eating insects and consorting across class lines. Farrell's descriptions of life inside the Residency are simultaneously horrifying and blackly humorous. The siege, for example, is conducted under the avid eyes of the local populace, who clearly anticipate an enjoyable massacre and thus arrive every morning laden with picnic lunches (plainly visible to the starving Europeans). By turns witty and compassionate, <i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i> comprises the best of all fictional worlds: unforgettable characters, an epic adventure, and at its heart a cultural clash for the ages. Quite simply, this is a splendid novel. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p>J.G.

Such is the assertion of Mark Galli, who in this IVP Histories volume strips away the modern gloss in order to discover the real man in his real physical, political, and social context. Writing with lively and engaging style, Galli traces the fascinating adventure of Francis's life, from his hedonistic youth to his emergence as a Christian leader of outstanding influence and passion. The saint revealed here is not the bland, romanticized free spirit of popular misconception, but a complex and contentious man who combined an irradiated mysticism with a very practical Christian commitment and, above all, sought to glorify God as Creator. <em>Francis of Assisi and His World</em> is a "must-read," both for the inspiring story it tells and for the beauty of its art and illustration.</p><p>Galli is the managing editor of <em>Christianity Today</em> magazine. He previously edited <em>Christian History</em>. He received a Master of Divinity degree from Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, and for 10 years served as a Presbyterian pastor in parishes in Mexico City and California. He has written books on preaching, prayer and the challenges of pastoral ministry, and is a contributing writer to <em>The Christian Millennial History Project</em>. He is married with three children.I was thoroughly impressed (not to mention frequently moved) by Galli's handling of Francis' story. Mark Galli manages to tell the story in a way that is fresh, engaging, and thought-provoking. This book (and all the books in this series) is a very attractive little volume with high-gloss pages and full-color artwork placed throughout. In short, if I were to recommend a biography of Francis to anybody wanting to understand this great Saint, this would be it. (Wyman Richardson, Walking Together, January 28, 2008)<br><br>"Few overviews of Christian history can rival the IVP Histories' winning mix of summary and storytelling. Aimed at a general audience, these expertly written books contain much to delight and inform even this long-time student of Christian history. Their size makes them easy to begin reading, and their beautiful images and clear, colorful writing make them hard to put down. A treasure!"

Gillette had thought he might be remembered as one of history's social and economic reformers. Instead he recalled as the inventor of the safety razor with its disposal blade and as the founder of the major American corporation that bears his name. <br><br> When Gillette, at the time a prosperous traveling salesman, first conceived of his blade in 1895, he was already well known in radical political circles. This year before, in a book titled 'The Human Drift,' he has proposed s sweeping plan to reorganize the entire world as a gigantic corporation that would be owned and managed by the people. Gillette evidently had hopes that the scheme would usher in an earthly paradise, and went on to spend much of his life promoting his peculiar version of Utopia. But, perversely, the world was more interested in the clean, close safe shaves that Gillette's razor gave than in his philosophy, so his curious economic and political notions have been all but forgotten. <br><br> 'King C. Gillette' chronicles Gillette's struggles to build first a better world, and then a better razor blade. It is the beguiling and entertaining story of a visionary who could, and did, practice free enterprise and preach vigorously against it with equal enthusiasm. <br><br> It is also the history of The Gillette Company. From the glory days of the 1920s through the ruinous Depression, from the 'Calvacade of Sports' and the Super Blue Blade, through the advent of stainless steel blades, it is the story of a durable and highly competitive enterprise that has changed and prospered beyond this founder's wildest dreams. <br><br> CONTENTS: I Have Got It * A New razor * Novel Blade, Novel Holder * An Epoch in This Company's History * Familiar to All Men * Cut-out Corner * A Spirit of Confidence * Look Sharp, Feel Sharp, Be Sharp * A Remarkable New Stainless Blade * Sustained Profitable Growth</p><p></p><h2>Che Guevara Reader: Writings on Politics &amp; Revolution</h2><p><p>A new, revised and expanded edition of an Ocean Press classic.</p><p>This reader is the bestselling, most comprehensive selection of Che Guevara&#x2019;s writings, letters and speeches available in English.

And how did this brilliant but obscure musician come to be hailed long after his death as the most important artist in early blues and a founding father of rock 'n' roll? </p><p>Elijah Wald provides the first thorough examination of Johnson's work and makes it the centerpiece for a fresh look at the entire history of the blues. He traces the music's rural folk roots but focuses on its evolution as a hot, hip African-American pop style, placing the great blues stars in their proper place as innovative popular artists during one of the most exciting periods in American music. He then goes on to explore how the image of the blues was reshaped by a world of generally white fans, with very different standards and dreams.</p><p>The result is a view of the blues from the inside, based not only on recordings but also on the recollections of the musicians themselves, the African-American press, and original research. Wald presents previously unpublished studies of what people on Delta plantations were actually listening to during the blues era, showing the larger world in which Johnson's music was conceived. What emerges is a new respect and appreciation for the creators of what many consider to be America's deepest and most influential music.</p><p>Wald also discusses how later fans formed a new view of the blues as haunting Delta folklore. While trying to separate fantasy from reality, he accepts that neither the simple history nor the romantic legend is the whole story. Each has its own fascinating history, and it is these twin histories that inform this book.</p></p><p><p>Elijah Waldis a writer and musician whose books include Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues and <em>How the Beatles Destroyed Rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; Roll: An Alternative History of American Popular Music</em>. A respected expert on the folk revival, he collaborated with Dave Van Ronk on <em>The Mayor of MacDougal Street</em>, the inspiration for the Coen Brothers&#x2019; film <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em>. His awards include a 2002 Grammy, and he has taught blues history at UCLA and lectured widely on American, Mexican, and world music. He currently lives in Medford, Massachusetts.</p><p> The congressional proclamation of 2003 as the "Year of the Blues" enabled all manner of film, concert and educational initiatives meant to raise public awareness and appreciation of a genre that Congress asserts "is the most influential form of American roots music." While few would argue otherwise, some have responded to all this Capitol Hill pomp by raising questions about the relevance of the blues in the 21st century, when the music's audience has skewed overwhelmingly white, and its most rabid supporters appear to be the fraternity of beer-ad music supervisors.</p><p> Elijah Wald is not so interested in what the blues means in its year of distinction, but he is very interested in how it came to mean something other than what it once did. In Escaping the Delta, he sets out to explore "the paradox of [Robert] Johnson's reputation: that his music excited so little interest among the black blues fans of his time, and yet is now widely hailed as the greatest and most important blues ever recorded." Wald sees this paradox as symbolizing a larger gulf between the blues as heard by the black audience in its own time -- who knew it as hip, popular music -- and a later, mostly white audience that romanticized the blues as "the heart-cry of a suffering people." Not a book about Johnson per se, Escaping the Delta is a thoughtful, impassioned historical essay about that gulf.</p><p>Wald spends the first several chapters laying out the prewar musical terrain in which the blues came to the fore, through a synthesis of murkily understood received culture and the skills of those who refined the blues into a consciously commercial -- not naively folk -- art. After a quick sketch of Johnson's life and a critical analysis of his recordings, Wald carries the story through to the folk-revival "discovery" of the blues in the 1950s and the British Invasion's canonizing stamp of the 1960s, then adds a coda in which he seeks to lay permanently to rest the resilient myth that Johnson met the devil at a crossroads and sold his soul for other-worldly musicianship.</p><p>If the first half of the story sounds a lot more interesting than the second, Wald may feel the same way. Escaping the Delta is most engaged in the early going, as he dismantles genre stereotypes via endearing tidbits such as that blues singer Memphis Minnie's set list included George Gershwin's "Lady Be Good" and that Johnson rated the Sons of the Pioneers' "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" among his favorite songs. The book is much more hurried and polemically loose on the downhill side, as Wald takes broad swipes at an uptight blues "cognoscenti" and cites more dully familiar anecdotes such as the time the Rolling Stones sat at the feet of Howlin' Wolf. A professional musician himself, Wald can regale a listener with pinpoint comparisons of Johnson and Kokomo Arnold recordings that were each waxed more than 60 years ago. Such record-geek soliloquies can clear out a cocktail party, but here they serve a reader well. For Wald is rarely less than convincing when he makes his case for what Johnson and the prewar blues audience were actually hearing in their own day.</p><p> Often it wasn't the blues. Repeatedly Wald drives home the point that neither the musicians nor the audience frequenting a Clarksdale, Miss., juke joint in 1937 likely limited their taste to visceral fare like Johnson's "Cross Road Blues." They'd probably never heard it. In Wald's estimation, black listeners tended to prefer the smooth, urbane vocals of the far better-selling (in Johnson's day) blues pianist Leroy Carr, and if the jukebox selections noted by a 1944 field recording team are any indication, some may have liked the "sweet band" leader Sammy Kaye better than either.</p><p> In this fashion Wald does not seek to temper admiration for Johnson and his brilliant Delta generation. Rather he wants to rescue them from a historical narrative he sees as having been edited by record producers (the blues were good business), folklorists (the blues were authentic) and Rolling Stones fans (the blues were outlaw), each of which had a separate agenda for the music.</p><p> But Wald's focus on folkies and Stones freaks is problematic. For all his interest in the complexity of black-white, blues-pop musical exchanges in the pre-World War II South, he largely ignores that dynamic as carried through to the volatile postwar context. The South is full of tales of white kids who during the segregation era snuck away to off-limits black nightclubs, and of black kids who grew up with their ears tuned to the Grand Ole Opry. Wald is rightly sympathetic to the frustrations of the latter (quoting Bobby "Blue" Bland, "it was the wrong time and the wrong place for a black singer to make it singing white country blues") but oddly uninterested in the experiences of the former. He mentions Elvis Presley mostly in passing and scarcely touches on the impact of postwar black radio. Yet that generation's story had every bit as much to do with evolving perceptions (and misperceptions) of the blues as did any folk revivalism or Stones evangelism.</p><p> Nevertheless, the best studies inspire further study, and the best music books inspire further listening. Escaping the Delta could well do both. Blank spots aside, one comes away respecting Wald's view that far too much time has been spent wondering if Robert Johnson really sold his soul to the devil, and far too little time listening at the musical crossroads where he actually lived. </p><p></p><p>Reviewed by Daniel Cooper</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

In the mid-1770s the country was intoxicated by a great surge of political energy. Re-discovering England&#39;s wildernesses, the intellectuals of the &#34;Romantic generation&#34; also discovered the plight of the common man, turning Nature into a revolutionary force. This power of the cult of nature enabled two things - to make man see and explore Britain in a way unimaginable a generation before, and to pit democrat cosmopolitans against patriots. From the politics of wildness, &#34;A History of Britain&#34; moves to the Victorian era and its question of how to create a better world in the face of upheaval. As the Victorian era began, the massive advance of technology and industrialisation was rapidly reshaping both the landscape and the social structure of the whole country. To a much greater extent than ever before women would take a centre stage role in shaping society.</p><p>Simon Schama is University Professor of Art History and History at Columbia University.

Drawing upon recent interviews with hundreds of his collaborators as well as with "The Voice" himself, this book is the only full-length work to chronicle, critique, and celebrate his five-decade career. Friedwald examines and evaluates all the classic and less familiar songs with the same astute, often witty, perceptions that earned him acclaim for<i> Jazz Singing.</i> With an authoritative discography and rare photos of recording sessions and performances, <i>Sinatra!</i> is an invaluable resource for enthusiasts and an unparalleled guide through his vast musical legacy.</p><p>Not surprisingly, most of Frank Sinatra&#39;s biographers have raked through the muck of the singer&#39;s marriages, divorces, mob connections, and outbursts of foul-mouthed misogyny.

Oh, the biographical facts are there, but Friedwald is mostly interested in the Voice--that irresistible, inimitable instrument, the absence of which would punch a major hole in the soundtrack of life. This is certainly the best book ever written on Sinatra&#39;s music, which means that it sheds a great deal of light on American pop music in general.

Parks Commissioner Heckscher (St. Paul's: The Life of a New England School, 1980; coauthor, When LaGuardia Was Mayor, 1978). Making full use of the Wilson papers, the author offers a solid if standard account of the president's life: the years as a popular political-science professor, president of Princeton Univ., New Jersey governor, and, of course, Chief Executive, when he championed innovative labor, tariff, and fiscal reforms and steered the nation through WW I. As might be expected of an erstwhile president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Heckscher sometimes defends his hero a little too much (e.g., he ascribes Wilson's dismal civil-rights record to the need to maintain a congressional consensus behind his legislation rather than to ingrained southern prejudices). Although he constantly emphasizes Wilson's passionate nature (including his devotion to his two wives and an apparent short-lived extramarital affair), other historians have already punched holes in the stereotype of the president as an arid intellectual. Instead, this biography is at its best in communicating the nature of Wilson's unusual charisma--a ``coming together of worldly good fortune with a feeling of inner blessedness'' in this son and grandson of Presbyterian ministers. In Heckscher's view, Wilson's fighting faith (he once said that, as President, ``a man must put on his war paint'') made him at his zenith an irresistibly persuasive and eloquent reformer--but, when his political instincts and health failed him (for instance, during the ill-starred fight to save the League of Nations), it led to disaster. A familiar, but convincing and sympathetic, argument for Wilson's greatness as presidential innovator and world statesman. (B&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This major biography of Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924) tracks his family background, his education, his transition from academician to political leader. We're shown his election to the White House in 1912, his legislative reforms, his early foreign-policy challenges in Mexico and Haiti, his superb leadership once America entered WW I, his role at the Paris Peace Conference, his attempt to gain popular support during the quarrel over Senate ratification of the Versailles Treaty, and his pitiful decline in health during his final years in office. Heckscher dismisses the notion that Wilson's wife, Edith, virtually ran the country during the latter period. What sets this well-written biography apart is the author's close attention to Wilson's emotional life (effectively revealed in certain of his letters). Heckscher succeeds in humanizing this rather forbidding man, although Wilson the "Noble" remains very much on display throughout--a man who "fought bravely, but too stubbornly, for high ends." Heckscher is former president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. Photos.

The city as the seat of enlightenment, sophistication, power and greed is in profound contrast with an innocent, peaceful, backward countryside. By examining literature since the sixteenth century, Williams traces the development of our conceptions of these two traditional poles of life. His groundbreaking study casts the country and city as central symbols for conceptualizing the social and economic changes associated with capitalist development.</p><p>RAYMOND WILLIAMS was born in 1921 in the Welsh border village of Pandy, and was educated at the village school, at Abergavenny Grammar School, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. After serving in the war as an anti-tank captain, he became an adult education tutor in the Oxford University Delegacy for Extra-Mural Studies. In 1947 he was an editor of Politics and Letters, and in the 1960s was general editor of the New Thinker's Library. He was elected Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1961 and was later appointed University Professor of Drama. Raymond Williams was married in 1942, had three children, and divided his time between Saffron Walden, near Cambridge, and Wales. He died in 1988. His books include&nbsp;<i>Culture and Society</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Long Revolution&nbsp;</i>(1961) and its sequel&nbsp;<i>Towards 2000</i>&nbsp;(1983);&nbsp;<i>Communications</i>&nbsp;(1962) and<i>Television: Technology and Cultural Form&nbsp;</i>(1974);&nbsp;<i>Drama in Performance</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>Modern Tragedy&nbsp;</i>(1966) and&nbsp;<i>Drama from Ibsen to Brecht&nbsp;</i>(1968);&nbsp;<i>The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence</i>&nbsp;(1970),&nbsp;<i>Orwell</i>&nbsp;(1971) and&nbsp;<i>The Country and the City</i>&nbsp;(1973);&nbsp;<i>Politics and Letters</i>&nbsp;(interviews) (1979) and&nbsp;<i>Problems in Materialism and Culture</i>&nbsp;(selected essays) (1980).&#34;While written with the energy of political engagement, it is a critically generous book...

The fever of the bazaar rose in her blood, a kind of jangled nervousness mingled with the vague feeling that one day in this teeming store things would come to a halt and her life would find its goal. It never occurred to her to think she could meet her destiny anywhere but here, in the overpowering smell of caramel, before the great mirrors hung on the wall with their narrow strips of gummed paper announcing the day&#x2019;s menu, to the summary clacking of the cash register, the very voice of her impatience. Everything in the place summed up for her the hasty, hectic poverty of her whole life here in St. Henri.<br><br>Over the shoulders of her half-dozen customers, her glance fled toward the counters of the store. The restaurant was at the back of the Five and Ten. In the glitter of the glassware, the chromed panels, the pots and pans, her empty, morose and expressionless ghost of a smile caught aimlessly on one glowing object after another.<br><br>Her task of waiting on the counter left her few moments in which she could return to the exciting, disturbing recollections of yesterday, except for tiny shards of time, just enough to glimpse the unknown young man&#x2019;s face in her mind&#x2019;s eye. The customers&#x2019; orders and the rattling of dishes didn&#x2019;t always break into her reverie, which, for a second, would cause a brief tremor in her features.<br><br>Suddenly she was disconcerted, vaguely humiliated.<br><br>While she had been keeping an eye on the crowd entering the store through the glass swing-doors, the young stranger had taken a place at the imitation-marble counter and was calling her over with an impatient gesture. She went toward him, her lips slightly open, in a pout rather than a smile. How maddening that he should catch her just at the moment when she was trying to remember how he looked and sounded!<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; he asked abruptly.<br><br>She was irritated, less by the question than by his way of asking: familiar, bantering, almost insolent.<br><br>&#x201c;What a question!&#x201d; she said contemptuously, though not really as if she wanted to end the conversation. On the contrary, her voice was inviting.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; said the young man, smiling. &#x201c;Mine&#x2019;s Jean. Jean L�vesque. And I know for a start yours is Florentine. Florentine this, Florentine that, Florentine&#x2019;s in bad humour today, got a smile for me, Florentine? Oh, I know your first name all right. I even like it.&#x201d;<br><br>He changed tone imperceptibly, his eyes hardened.<br><br>&#x201c;But if I call you miss, miss who? Won&#x2019;t you tell little old me?&#x201d; he insisted with mock seriousness.<br><br>He leaned toward her and looked up with eyes whose impudence was apparent in a flash. It was his tough, strong-willed chin and the unbearable mockery of his dark eyes that she noticed most today, and, this made her furious. How could she have spent so much time in the last few days thinking about this boy? She straightened up with a jerk that made her little amber necklace rattle.<br><br>&#x201c;And I guess after that you&#x2019;ll want to know where I live and what I&#x2019;m doing tonight,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I know you guys.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You guys? What do you mean, you guys?&#x201d; he mocked, looking over his shoulder as if there were someone behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;Just . . . you guys!&#x201d; she said, half exasperated.<br><br>His familiar, slightly vulgar tone, which put him on her level, displeased her less than his usual behaviour and speech. Her smile returned, irritated but provocative.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, now!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What do you want today?&#x201d;<br><br>Once again his look had that brutal familiarity.<br><br>&#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t got around to asking what you&#x2019;re doing tonight,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t in that big a hurry. Normally I&#x2019;d take another three days at least. But now you mention it. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He leaned back a little on the stool and weaved gently from side to side. As he stared at her, his eyes narrowed.<br><br>&#x201c;Now then! Florentine, what&#x2019;re you doing tonight?&#x201d;<br><br>He saw that she was upset. Her lower lip was trembling, and she held it with her teeth. Then she busied herself pulling a paper napkin from a chrome box, unfolded it and spread it on the counter.<br><br>Her face was thin, delicate, almost childish. The effort she was making to control herself caused the small, blue veins on her temples to swell and knot, and her almost diaphanous nostrils, closing, pulled tight the skin of her cheeks, as smooth and delicate as silk. Her lips were still uncertain, still threatening to tremble, but Jean, looking in her eyes, was suddenly struck by their expression. Under the arched line of her plucked eyebrows, extended by a little streak of makeup, her lowered lids could not hide the thin bronze ray of a glance, cautious, attentive and extraordinarily eager. Then she blinked, and the whole pupil showed with a sudden gleam. Over her shoulders fell a mass of light-brown hair.<br><br>With no particular purpose the young man was watching her intently. She astonished more than she attracted him. And even this phrase he had just uttered, &#x201c;What are you doing tonight?&#x201d; . . . had been unexpected. It had taken shape in his mind without his knowing; he had tossed it out as one drops a pebble to test an unknown depth. But her reaction encouraged him to try again. Would I be ashamed to go out with her? he wondered. And then the idea that such a thought could intervene after he had gone this far pushed him on to greater daring. Elbows on the counter, eyes staring into Florentine&#x2019;s, he was waiting, as if in a cruel game, for a move from her to which he could react.<br><br>She stiffened under his brutal scrutiny, and he was able to see her better. He saw her upper body reflected in the wall mirror, and he was struck by her thinness. She had pulled the belt of her green uniform as tight as it would go around her waist, but you could see that her clothing barely clung to her slender body. And the young man had a sudden glimpse of what her life must be like, in the rush and bustle of St. Henri, that life of spruce young girls with rouged cheeks reading fifteen-cent serial novels and burning their fingers at the wretched little fires of what they took for love.<br><br>His voice grew incisive, almost cutting.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re from here? From St. Henri?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>She shrugged her shoulders, and her only reply was a vexed, ironical smile, again more like a pout.<br><br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; he went on, with mocking condescension.<br><br>&#x201c;So we can be friends, eh?&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand</h2><p>This brilliantly conceived and organized book is based on a lecture course given by Dr. Leonard Peikoff in 1976, entitled &#34;The Philosophy of Objectivism.&#34; The lectures were attended by Ayn Rand, who helped prepare them and also joined Peikoff in answering questions. Ayn Rand said of these lectures: &#34;Until or unless I write a comprehensive treatise on my philosophy, Dr. Peikoff&#39;s course is the only authorized presentation of the entire theoretical structure of Objectivism--that is, the only one that I know of my own knowledge to be fully accurate.&#34; Dr. Peikoff, Rand&#39;s designated heir and foremost interpreter, reveals the abstract fundamentals of Objectivism and its practical applications in the everyday world. He covers every branch of philosophy recognized by Rand and every philosophic topic she regarded as important--from certainty to money, from logic to art, from measurement to sex.

He worked closely with Ayn Rand for thirty years and was designated by her as heir to her estate. He has taught philosophy at Hunter College, Long Island University, and New York University and lectures on Rand's philosophy throughout the country. He lives in Southern California.</p>Peikoff, Rand's heir and authorized evangelist, tries to present the definitive apologetic for her individualist gospel. Libraries could certainly use a book explaining a writer whose works still sell half a million copies a year. But Rand's success is rooted in the unsubtle but dramatic Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged , not in tracts like Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal . And this book mostly summarizes those tracts. There are sophisticated defenses like those in Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia ( LJ 1/15/75) for some Rand doctrines, but Peikoff, as official expositor, is bound to the received word. Odd claims like, "monopolies achieved under capitalism . . . depend on merit and do no harm" abound. In pursuit of Randian orthodoxy, he must denounce leftists, but he goes further and holds that "historically, from the Sherman Act to Herbert Hoover to the Bush Administration, it is the conservatives, not the leftists, who have always been the major destroyers of the United States."-- Leslie Armour, Univ. of Ottawa<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Boston Tea Party (American Girl: Real Stories From My Time) (3)</h2><p>Discover the stories of the real people and events that shaped American history in the Real Stories From My Time series.

Krakauer&#39;s investigation is a meticulously researched, bone-chilling narrative of polygamy, savage violence and unyielding faith: an incisive, gripping work of non-fiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behaviour. &#39;A provocative look at the twisted roots of American fundamentalism&#39; Will Self, Evening Standard Books of the Year &#39;Excellent ...a lucid, judicious, even sympathetic account not just of Mormon Fundamentalism but of the seductive power of fanaticism in general&#39; Daily Telegraph &#39;Krakauer writes exceptionally well: as thrilling as Capote on true crime, as devastating as Nietzsche on religious fundamentalism&#39; Scotland on Sunday &#39;Remarkable ...for anyone interested in the wilder frontiers of spiritual conviction, this book is a must&#39; Independent &#39;Krakauer is an adept chronicler of extremists, and he&#39;s as intent on understanding religious fanatics as he was in his earlier books on exploring the obsessions of monomaniacal adventurers&#39; Los Angeles Times</p><p>In 1984, Ron and Dan Lafferty murdered the wife and infant daughter of their younger brother Allen. The crimes were noteworthy not merely for their brutality but for the brothers' claim that they were acting on direct orders from God. In <i>Under the Banner of Heaven</i>, Jon Krakauer tells the story of the killers and their crime but also explores the shadowy world of Mormon fundamentalism from which the two emerged. The Mormon Church was founded, in part, on the idea that true believers could speak directly with God. But while the mainstream church attempted to be more palatable to the general public by rejecting the controversial tenet of polygamy, fundamentalist splinter groups saw this as apostasy and took to the hills to live what they believed to be a righteous life. When their beliefs are challenged or their patriarchal, cult-like order defied, these still-active groups, according to Krakauer, are capable of fighting back with tremendous violence. While Krakauer's research into the history of the church is admirably extensive, the real power of the book comes from present-day information, notably jailhouse interviews with Dan Lafferty. Far from being the brooding maniac one might expect, Lafferty is chillingly coherent, still insisting that his motive was merely to obey God's command. Krakauer's accounts of the actual murders are graphic and disturbing, but such detail makes the brothers' claim of divine instruction all the more horrifying. In an age where Westerners have trouble comprehending what drives Islamic fundamentalists to kill, Jon Krakauer advises us to look within America's own borders. <i>--John Moe</i>Jon Krakauer?s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. In UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this<b> </b>?divinely inspired? crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion,<b> </b>savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America?s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.<br><br>Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and<b> </b>Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five ?plural wives,? several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents. <br><br>Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism?s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Boys from Brazil</h2><p>Six former SS men, dispatched from Brazil by the notorious former commandant of Auschwitz to kill ninety-four men, become the targets of aging, increasingly shortsighted Nazi-hunter Yakov Liebermann</p><p>Ira Levin is the author of The Boys from Brazil, A Kiss Before Dying, Sliver, The Stepford Wives, and other bestsellers, as well as Broadway&#39;s longest-running thriller, Deathtrap.

He knew that upon their deaths, he would have to get his sister, Molly, out of the house so he could bring in a new mistress&#x2014;a wife. He already had his eye on Annie Hayes, a young woman who lived on the far end of the town in a cottage on the edge of the marsh but still in the bog.<br> <br>JohnJoe was a good planner; he had a plan.<br> <br>His distant cousin Kate Larkin, an aged spinster living in the townland of Aganloo, was the sole survivor of a farm-owning family. Kate was also related to JohnJoe&#x2019;s uncle Pake Nugent, whom JohnJoe disliked immensely. &#x201c;Pake&#x2019;s nothing but a land grabber!&#x201d; he would snipe.<br> <br>With the future relocation of Molly on his mind and Kate Larkin within a death rattle of the grave, JohnJoe bought a strawberry-jam Swiss roll and set off one Sunday morning in his pony-and-trap to travel the eight miles to Aganloo. Upon arrival, he made tea for Kate and himself, then sweetened his cousin&#x2019;s toothless mouth with the Swiss roll. &#x201c;Ah, JohnJoe,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;this cake is nice and aisy on me oul gums.&#x201d;<br> <br>JohnJoe went down on one knee before the ailing woman. &#x201c;Sure, Kate, I have a favor to ask of ye. I&#x2019;ll have a hard time getting a wife as long as Molly is living at home with me. Would ye ever think of leaving yer house and farm to her?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kate generously told him to arise. &#x201c;JohnJoe, I&#x2019;ll be changing me will tomorrow, and when I&#x2019;m wearing me shroud, this place will be Molly&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;m just sorry I&#x2019;ll miss yer weddin.&#x201d;<br> <br>JohnJoe sliced the rest of the Swiss roll and placed it on a chair convenient to his benefactress. Then he set out for home, his success bearing him up. But as his pony trotted down Kate Larkin&#x2019;s avenue, he met Pake Nugent coming up the road on his rattling bike. JohnJoe assumed that Pake, with five sons and four daughters, was about to ask Kate for her farm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you bring her anything, Pake?&#x201d; JohnJoe called. &#x201c;I brought her a Swiss roll.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe she&#x2019;ll give me a bit,&#x201d; Pake shouted back.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be the only thing she can give you!&#x201d;<br> <br>JohnJoe could not contain himself, and he roared out laughter as loud as the bawl of a mare ass.<br> <br>Not long after JohnJoe&#x2019;s visit to Aganloo, old Kate breathed her last, and soon Molly immigrated to the Larkin farm, JohnJoe driving his horse-and-cart with beds, mattresses, and a few other sticks. His sister drove on ahead in the pony-and-trap; Molly would not be seen in a horse&#x2019;s cart in close proximity to an equine arse. After all, she was now a landowner.<br> <br>Free of his sister, JohnJoe wiped the muck and the cow dung off his wellingtons and set about entrapping Annie Hayes in his amorous plans.</p><h2>Kosher by Design Lightens Up: Fabulous food for a healthier lifestyle</h2><p>This sixth volume in Susie Fishbein's celebrated Kosher by Design cookbook series was crafted with your good health in mind!

There was no choice but to convince himself that his notion was on solid grounds. Heinemann looked at thousands of pictures he had taken earlier, and thousands more would be taken to test the hypothesis that these light circles are nothing less than emanations from Spirit beings. <br> <br> Dr. M�ce�l Ledwith had a similar experience after the orb phenomenon was first made known to him through the teachings of Ramtha. He began an intense and systematic study of orbs in all sort of situations, day and night, and in all sorts of atmospheric conditions, in order to discover all he could about their nature, the situations in which their presence could be most easily detected, and what implications they might have for our understanding of our own place in the cosmos. To date, he has amassed a collection of well over 100,000 images. <br> <br> In <i>The Orb Project</i>, Ledwith and Heinemann present their fascinating discoveries, along with practical tips that amateur digital photographers can use to photograph orbs and properly distinguish them from "false" orbs that are really dust or water particles. They offer guidelines on deciphering the orbs' various patterns, features, and characteristics, based on their extensive research. <br> <br> As Dr. Ledwith points out, once you develop a keen and sustained interest in photographing spirit entities, some quite interesting things begin to happen: the brain stops censoring these images, and you can begin to see with orbs with the naked eye -- in more color and detail than is visible to even a digital camera. <br> <br> Ledwith and Heinemann also explore communication with orbs and what their existence means to our lives. The implications of a realization that we are "surrounded by a cloud of witnesses" are enormous and incredibly hopeful for the world at large.</p><p>Klaus Heinemann, PhD, was born and educated in Germany. He holds a PhD in experimental physics from the University of Tumbingen. Dr. Heinemann worked for many years in materials science research at NASA, UCLA, and as a research professor at Stanford University. He is founder and chairman of a corporation that performs scientific research in computational fluid dynamics, materials development, and nanotechnology under contracts from NASA. For several decades, Dr. Heinemann has worked on mending the commonly perceived rift between science and spirituality and lectures on expanding perception.<br><br>Miceal Ledwith, PhD, was Professor of Systematic Theology for sixteen years at Maynooth College in Ireland and subsequently served for ten years as president of the university.<br><br>He was a member of the International Theological Commission, a small group of theologians of international standing, charged with advising the Holy See on theological matters. He also served as Chairman of the Committee of Heads of the Irish Universities and as a member of the governing Bureau of the Conference of European University Presidents (CRE).<br><br>He has lectured extensively throughout Europe, South Africa, Japan, Australia, Mexico, and North America. His forthcoming books are <i>The Message Whose Time Has Come Again</i> and <i>The Ascent to God: The Soul&#x2019;s Journey Within</i>."A well-researched examination of a remarkable modern phenomena, with enormous implications for our current scientific story and indeed our current sense of the possible." -- Lynne McTaggart, author of the bestellers, <i>The Field</i> and <i>The Intention Experiment</i><br><br>"Orbs may be to the atmosphere what crop circles are to the earth. Having seen orbs and had them photographed while I am speaking, it is great to know that we are receiving cosmic energetic communication." -- C. Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph. D., Holos University Graduate Seminary president, International Society for the Study of Subtle Energy and Energy Medicine, author of <i>Life Beyond 100 - Secrets of the Fountain of Youth</i><br><br>"<i>The Orb Project</i> helps us peer into a very weird phenomenon with some sobriety and discernment. Even Einstein referred to the puzzling world of quantum entanglement as 'spooky action at a distance' before it was better understood. Breakthroughs in science come when we are prepared to explore persistent anomalies. Orbs may just be evidence that can only be explained outside of the box of current limiting and reductionist worldviews." -- James O'Dea, president, Institute of Noetic Sciences.</p><h2>The Use of the Self</h2><p><p><b>The world famous classic by the originator of the Alexander Technique</b></p><p>Frederick Matthias Alexander was born in Tasmania in 1869.

From the special perspectives of "my corner of Europe," a classical and Catholic education, a serious encounter with Marxism, and a life marked by journeys and exiles, Milosz has developed a sensibility at once warm and detached, flooded with specific memory yet never hermetic or provincial. </p><p> Milosz addresses many of the major problems of contemporary poetry, beginning with the pessimism and negativism prompted by reductionist interpretations of man's animal origins. He examines the tendency of poets since Mallarm� to isolate themselves from society, and stresses the need for the poet to make himself part of the great human family. One chapter is devoted to the tension between classicism and realism; Milosz believes poetry should be "a passionate pursuit of the real." In "Ruins and Poetry" he looks at poems constructed from the wreckage of a civilization, specifically that of Poland after the horrors of World War II. Finally, he expresses optimism for the world, based on a hoped-for better understanding of the lessons of modern science, on the emerging recognition of humanity's oneness, and on mankind's growing awareness of its own history. </p></p><p>&#39;Milosz is at all times direct, even simple. He has the ability to return the pleasures of poetry to ordinary readers, and in his prose, as here, he makes you suspect that the great intellectual sin of our time may be a fear of the obvious.&#39;Vanity Fair<b>Milosz</b> is the first Slavic poet to hold the Charles Eliot Norton Professorship at Harvard University.

Creative writing, he feels, draws on a need to tell stories ("all fiction is gossip") so obsessive that even mundane difficulties or the specter of rejection fail to stop the flow. Because reading fine writers promotes good writing, he suggests many apt titles and includes, from writers such as Dickens, Thurber, Hemingway, and others, passages that exhibit mastery of elements that daunt beginners, such as mood and dialog.

Critically acclaimed both in the US and in England, Campbell is widely regarded as one of the genre's literary lights for both his short fiction and his novels. His classic novels, such as <i>The Face that Must Die, The Doll Who Ate His Mother,</i> and<i> The Influence</i>, set new standards for horror as literature. His collection, <i>Scared Stiff</i>, virtually established the subgenre of erotic horror.<br> <br>Ramsey Campbell's works have been published in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, and several other languages. He has been President of the British Fantasy Society and has edited critically acclaimed anthologies, including <i>Fine Frights</i>. Campbell's best known works in the US are <i>Obsession, Incarnate, Midnight Sun, </i>and<i> Nazareth Hill</i>. <br><br>Campbell's seventh novel is set in Northern England, in the small bleak town of Moonwell, edged by moors pitted with treacherous mineshafts. To Moonwell comes the preacher Godwin Mann, whose particularly intolerant brand of fundamentalism appeals to the inhabitants. They rally almost as one behind him and ostracize and persecute the few independent souls who do not. Mann descends into the pit in which the ancient malignant being worshipped by the Druids millenia past is said to dwell. Intending to exorcise the demon and claim the land for God, he is instead overwhelmed. What emerges from the pit is the monstrous creature, clothed now in the flesh of Mann, and it is only the town's pariahs who can see that something is radically wrong, that an evil has been unleashed on the community. Slowly Moonwell is isolated from the world, as telephone lines break down, a cloud cover brings continuous darkness, watches and clocks stop, roads mysteriously lead nowhere. And within this isolation, the monster's power grows umimpeded. This horror story is beautifully written, populated with well-realized characters and pervaded by an increasingly chilling atmosphere of dread and anxiety.

Not without a push, usually from me.</p><p>Against his usual custom, this time he hadn&#x2019;t even ridden a special train from city to city and town to town, giving whistle-stop speeches to impromptu crowds; events had kept him pinned to Washington.</p><p>Not that it matters, the result&#x2019;s even more of a foregone conclusion than it was in 1912, and that was never in doubt after poor Taft&#x2019;s heart attack. How long ago that seems!</p><p>A horrible thought occurred to him: God have mercy on us, if Taft had lived Woodrow Woodenhead Wilson might be president now and facing this!</p><p>He shook his head as if to shed the image, though the news was bad enough to inspire any number of morbid fantasies. God or fate or destiny had spared the United States that at least. He&#x2019;d swept back into office on an unprecedented wave of support, the strongest mandate since George Washington&#x2019;s, a vote for his plans to seize the dawning century for America and the New Nationalism.</p><p>One of the things he&#x2019;d done since was take the nation by the scruff and make it face up to the fact that it was a dangerous world now and that you had to be prepared.</p><p>Getting elected is only important because of what you do once you are. These maps are more important than electioneering.</p><p>There were three on the section of wall he was staring at, showing Paris, London, and Bordeaux&#x2014;where the top echelon of the French government had retreated after the first airborne gas attack on Paris in May, which had seemed so terrible at the time but had only contained conventional phosgene and only killed thousands.</p><p>All three maps had broad, shaded marks on them, shaped roughly like an overlapping series of blobby elongated teardrops. That showed where the German super-Zeppelin bombers had dropped fifty to a hundred tons of the Vernichtungsgas on each city.</p><p>The enemy were calling it that, Annihilation Gas, though he preferred the popular coinage of horror-gas. The scientists termed it organo-methylphosphonothioate nerve agent X and claimed it wasn&#x2019;t even a gas at normal temperatures, strictly speaking, and more importantly they&#x2019;d found that a single liter of it&#x2014;two pints&#x2014;held a million lethal doses if perfectly distributed. The half-ton canisters of horror-gas had burst at a thousand feet, or sometimes wherever burning airships had exploded under attack by fighting-scout aeroplanes. Then the winds had carried the finely divided aerosol of drops over square miles of city as they settled. Most of the zeppelins had died over their targets or crashed on their way back, but they had taken three cities with them.</p><p>Below the maps were slots where estimates from Military Intelligence and the Black Chamber&#x2014;and the allied governments, or what was left of them, were updated daily. Paris and London each showed over six hundred thousand dead and climbing fast; Bordeaux much less, but if anything a higher proportion of its smaller population. Nobody had any idea how many more civilians had been crippled or driven mad by marginal doses on the fringes of the killing zones; the gas was so persistent, especially in cold weather or sheltered spots or soaked into skin and cloth and hair and wood, that you couldn&#x2019;t go near the contaminated areas except in something like a deep-sea diver&#x2019;s rubber suit.</p><p>And nobody has any idea of how many have just run for their lives and are starving in ditches. The Kaiser&#x2019;s plot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or Hindenburg and Ludendorff&#x2019;s plot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cut the heads off two great nations at a stroke, he thought with throttled rage. And came within a hair of wrecking us, if the Chamber hadn&#x2019;t stopped it. When we win this war, everyone involved will hang.</p><p>One of his military aides cleared his throat and took a brief glance at his newfangled wristwatch. Roosevelt nodded brusquely and followed horse-faced young Bradley&#x2019;s jug ears down an arch-roofed corridor toward the meeting room. Two motionless Marine guards with Thompson guns on assault slings across their bellies and faces like carved wood under their turtle-shaped steel helmets flanked the door, snapping to attention for an instant and then returning to their watchfulness.</p><p>The president walked past them and sat at the head of the big oval table, nodding to the respectful greetings and salutes. There was a general rustle as files were opened and pads made ready. There were maps here too, set up on easels or hanging before the walls, mostly of Europe and North Africa, some of Asia.</p><p>And none showing things I wanted to see.</p><p>With the Chiefs of Staff was Director Wilkie, head of the Secret Service and more importantly of the&#x2014;until recently&#x2014;officially nonexistent subsection that had grown to utterly overshadow it, the Black Chamber. Whose motto was Ex umbris, acies: From the shadows, steel.</p><p>Though they think I don&#x2019;t know that the unofficial Chamber motto is Non Theodorum parvis concitares ne perturbatus sit, which means &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother Teddy with the details, it&#x2019;ll just upset him&#x201d;!</p><p>&#x201c;Right, gentlemen. We&#x2019;re here to appraise the general situation and make sure we&#x2019;re all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. reading from the same page, as it were.&#x201d;</p><p>That phrase was his own coinage, and he thought it was rather pithy.</p><p>&#x201c;And there are some political developments&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. integrating Canada, for instance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that will give you enough extra work to keep you from the temptations of idleness and dissipation.&#x201d;</p><p>He grinned at that, and there were tired chuckles; none of the men in the room looked as if they were getting enough sleep, and he knew he wasn&#x2019;t. He could barely squeeze in an hour or two a day swimming and wrestling and working the punching bag.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me some bad news, Leonard,&#x201d; Roosevelt said to the head of the General Staff. &#x201c;Start with the bad, at least, and work your way up to the unthinkably terrible. We can do a world tour; it&#x2019;s a world war now that we&#x2019;re officially in it at last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. President, other resources may be short, but of bad news in all flavors we can give you any amount,&#x201d; Leonard Wood said in his soft New England accent.</p><p>His long craggy Yankee face was professionally impassive and his voice calm, but they&#x2019;d been friends for decades and had commanded the Rough Riders together. Roosevelt could tell grimness when it spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;Apart from the fact that the Mexican Protectorate is finally quiet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fairly quiet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bad news is about all we have on the menu.&#x201d;</p><p>Roosevelt&#x2019;s lips tightened beneath his bushy mustache as he listened to the catalog of disasters that followed. The United States had been forced into a war where Germany stood triumphant. From the ruins and chaos of Russia, through the mass flight of the French to North Africa and on to the desperate heroism of the British rearguards, dying where they stood under hammer-storms of steel and poisoned fire to shelter the improvised evacuation from Dunkirk and Calais. That was an epic that might breed a legend for the future, but right now it was another defeat.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t war as he&#x2019;d known it as colonel of the Rough Riders or dreamed of even in nightmares&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nobody had but H. G. Wells, whose The War in the Air was starting to look horribly prophetic in this day of the breaking of nations&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but there was no denying that it worked. His only consolation was that this time, for once in the history of the United States, he&#x2019;d ensured that America was more or less ready for a fight at the start of a conflict. Against the Germans there wasn&#x2019;t much margin for error or time to learn on the job.</p><p>When the litany of blood and destruction was finished, Roosevelt set his palms on the reddish-brown Cuban mahogany of the table and spoke:</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, General Wood. There you have it, gentlemen. Our course is clear for the immediate future. There remains one matter of very serious import, which Director Wilkie and Admiral Sims will now outline.&#x201d;</p><p>Wilkie of the Black Chamber took his cue. &#x201c;The Imperial German Navy is making serious preparations to sortie sometime in the next few months; we have that by the reports of agents who saw Wilhelmshaven in person, and it&#x2019;s confirmed by our cryptographic work and that of the Royal Navy. Which makes no sense, which means we&#x2019;re all missing something. Something crucial, something that could bite us on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a sensitive place.&#x201d;</p><p>Admiral Sims stroked his short-clipped white-shot beard. &#x201c;Naval Intelligence agrees. We and the Royal Navy together have overwhelming superiority, and the short days and bad weather at this time of year mean that such an action would be a close-in slugging match, which adds to our advantage of numbers and weight of metal&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they can do the arithmetic too. They have some ace up their sleeve. A surprise.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The world has lost far too much to far too many German surprises already,&#x201d; Roosevelt agreed. &#x201c;Director Wilkie, finding out what they have planned is now your absolute priority. If we lose control of the North Sea, Britain goes with it, and Berlin will rule everything from Ireland to the Urals. God may know how we&#x2019;d come back from that, but I do not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. President, we&#x2019;re on it.&#x201d;</p><p>The Black Chamber&#x2019;s director looked quietly confident. Everyone else in the room was looking at him with respect at the least, shading up into hero worship from some of the younger officers.</p><p>The details were deeply secret, but it was generally known that the Germans had tried to wreck the main American port cities on the Atlantic with horror-gas attacks from specially built U-boats even before the declaration of war. That would have slaughtered millions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and killed any chance of thwarting the mad dream of a German-dominated world.</p><p>But the Black Chamber had thoroughly thwarted it&#x2014;only the one in Savannah had struck, and there had been enough warning that the city had been evacuated first.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m putting my best field operatives on it, Mr. President,&#x201d; Wilkie said.</p><p>Their eyes met. Roosevelt knew who he meant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and what the cost might be to someone who&#x2019;d romped as a child with his own sons and daughters, whose father had gone up San Juan Hill with him, and whom he&#x2019;d held as she wept over her murdered parents. His own four sons were in the Army, even young Quentin who was only a lad of nineteen and heedlessly eager to be a man. All the boys were in fighting units&#x2014;including the new Air Corps&#x2014;by their own wish and doing well by their own merits. He feared for them every day, but it would have broken his heart if any of them had tried to avoid front-line service.</p><p>Black Chamber operative Luz O&#x2019;Malley and that charming, eccentric young Boston girl Ciara Whelan had saved the nation from the German horror-gas plot with cold cunning and high courage&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but a great nation needed a great deal of saving in this terrible new age, and they were willing and ready to run the risks again, risks worse than going over the top in the face of Maxim guns and mustard gas.</p><p>We do not exist for ourselves alone, none of us do. That&#x2019;s why I went to Cuba even though Edith was so very sick and our children so young, though I felt as if I were torn in two. We are the tools of something greater than any of us, and if the tool breaks beneath the strain&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then another steps forward and the greater purpose goes on. The lines of blood. And beyond that, the nation that is the embodiment and bloodline of all our people.</p><p>Roosevelt nodded to the Black Chamber&#x2019;s director, a slight crisp gesture to affirm his choice. Wilkie returned it and went on:</p><p>&#x201c;My very best operatives, Mr. President&#x2014;and there aren&#x2019;t any better in the world.&#x201d;</p><p></p><br><p>Chapter One</p><p>Casa de los Amantes,</p><p>Santa Barbara, California</p><p>November 17, 1916(b)</p><p>&#x201c;Now that was a strange and lovely dinner, my darling, and fine people,&#x201d; Ciara Whelan said dreamily from behind the wheel of the auto. &#x201c;Though it&#x2019;s good to be home, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Glad you enjoyed yourself, querida,&#x201d; Black Chamber operative Luz O&#x2019;Malley Ar�stegui said over her shoulder as she swung the wrought-iron gates closed behind them and shot the bolt with a clank.</p><p>And speaking of joy, it&#x2019;s finally here, she thought as she fished a small package out of the mailbox built into the thickness of the wall beside the gate and slipped it into the pocket of her skirt.</p><p>&#x201c;I had fun too,&#x201d; she added sincerely.</p><p>Warmed sake was insidious, but neither of them was more than slightly elevated, and very pleasantly satisfied but not full. Their hosts had laid on the full seven-course splendor of a kaiseki-ryori, but Japanese cooking at that level hewed to an austere and elegant restraint. The Taguchis couldn&#x2019;t have afforded a feast like that back in Hiroshima Prefecture&#x2014;Mrs. Taguchi ...</p></p><h2>Homeopathy: The Great Riddle</h2><p>This is a wonderfully succinct book which sets forth the history, essence, and methodology of homeopathy. The book is well organized in 5 major sections. There is a very thorough overview of the precepts and tenets of the practice, its historical origins, a detailed and well-covered biography of Samuel Hahnemann and a review of the politics of the allopathy v. homeopathy debate. It is further embellished with copious annotations, an appendix with an actual case history and a very fine reference for homeopathic resources such as organizations, suppliers and other texts covering a variety of related topics. Call it a perfect Homeopathy 101 text if you will, the author makes a very even-handed presentation of the material, including the politics of medicine as they have evolved in the USA over the past century.</p><p>Richard Grossinger was born in New York City in 1944. He received a B.A. from Amherst College in 1966 ad a Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Michigan in 1975. He is the author of many books, including<i> The Night Sky, Embryogenesis, and Homeopathy: An Introduction for Skeptics and Beginners</i>. He lives with his wife Lindy Hough in Berkeley, California."Grossinger has distilled the essence of each of the concepts in homeopathy and explained them as clearly as can be stated."- Julian Winston"This is an excellent introduction both to the issues within homeopathy and to the social issues around homeopathy....How often is it that a writer presents cogent sociology, history, and anthropology, alongside an obvious ethical commitment, not merely to a solution, but to the intricacies of the problem and, beyond that, emanates a strong faith in a mysterious project called 'alchemy'?"- Iain Marrs"Grossinger is penetrating in his analysis of homeopathy. His lucid, informative, and sympathetic account demonstrates how homeopathic theory is itself a critique of standard medical practice."-<i> Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Valor&#39;s Choice (Valor Novel)</h2><p><b>The first book in Tanya Huff's action-packed military sci-fi adventure Confederation series</b><br><br>Staff Sergeant Torin Kerr was a battle-hardened professional.

Sure, there&#x2019;d been rumors of the Others&#x2014;the sworn enemies of the Confederation&#x2014;being spotted in this sector of space. But there were always rumors.

The first is that the number of planets where biological accidents occurred in the correct order to create life is small. The second is that the number of planets where life managed to overcome the odds and achieve sentience is smaller still. And the third is that many of these sentient life-forms blow themselves into extinction before they ever make it off their planet of origin.</p><p>If space is big and mostly uninhabited, it should be safe to assume that any life-forms who really didn&#x2019;t get along could avoid spending time in each other&#x2019;s company.</p><p>Unfortunately, the fact that said life-forms <i>could</i> avoid each other doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean that they would.</p><p>When the Others attacked systems on the borders of Confederation territory, Parliament sent out a team of negotiators to point out that expansion in any other direction would be more practical as it would not result in conflict. The negotiators were returned in a number of very small pieces, their ship cleverly rigged to explode when it would do the most damage.</p><p>The Confederation found itself at a disadvantage. Its member races had achieved an interstellar presence only after they&#x2019;d overcome the urge to destroy themselves or any strangers they ran into. Evidence suggested the Others had flung themselves into space without reaching this level of maturity. Clearly, in order to survive, the Confederation would have to recruit some more aggressive members.</p><p>Humans had a bare-bones space station and a shaky toe-hold on Mars when the Confederation ships appeared. Some fairly basic technology by Confederation standards, combined with the information that the Others were heading Earth&#x2019;s way, convinced humanity to throw its military apparatus into space where they took to interstellar warfare the way the H&#x2019;san took to cheese.</p><p>Some one and a half centuries of intermittent war later, borders had shifted, and Humans had been joined by first the di&#x2019;Taykan and then the Krai. Much of the military terminology introduced into the Confederation&#x2019;s common tongue remained Human although, as the three races became increasingly more integrated, di&#x2019;Taykan and Krai words began creeping in. The Krai, for example, had sixteen useful adjectives describing the impact of an antipersonnel weapon on a soft target.</p><p>Although the induction of younger and more aggressive species had undeniably solved the problem presented by the Others, it had also irrevocably changed the face of the Confederation. Feeling just a little overwhelmed, many of the original species spent their spare time sighing and reminiscing about the good old days.</p><p><b>ONE</b></p><p><b>R</b>eveillie was not the best thing to have reverberating through one&#x2019;s skull after a night of too much and too little in various combinations. Making a mental note to change the program to something less painfully intrusive, Torin tongued the implant and tried to remember how to open her eyes during the five blessed seconds of silence before the first of her messages came in.</p><p><i>*At the chime, it will be 0530.*</i></p><p>The chime set up interesting patterns on the inside of her lids. What <i>had</i> she been drinking?</p><p><i>*Your liberty will be over at 0600.*</i></p><p>Which might be a problem, considering how much trouble she was having with basic bodily functions. Groping for the panel beside the bed, she applied what she hoped was enough pressure for dim lighting and cautiously cracked an eye. From the little she could see, these were not her quarters. The less than state-of-the-art wall utility suggested station guest quarters&#x2014;for a not particularly important guest.</p><p>Finally managing to sort current sensation from memory, she turned her head toward the warm body pressed up against her side. The di&#x2019;Taykan&#x2019;s short lilac hair swayed gently in response to her exhalation, the pointed tip of an ear covered and uncovered by the moving strands.</p><p>A di&#x2019;Taykan.</p><p>That explained things. It wasn&#x2019;t a hangover, she had pheromone head.</p><p>Sliding out from under the blanket, Torin stood, stretched carefully, and filled her lungs with air that hadn&#x2019;t been warmed by the di&#x2019;Taykan&#x2019;s body heat. As memories returned, she smiled. Not only did Humans find the Taykan incredibly attractive, but a Taykan in the di&#x2019; phase was one of the most indiscriminately enthusiastic life-forms in the Galaxy and offered the perfect and uncomplicated way to chase the memories of that last horrible planetfall right back to the galactic core.</p><p><i>*Captain Rose wants to see you in his office at 0800.*</i></p><p>There were two piles of clothing on the room&#x2019;s one chair, both folded into neatly squared-off piles. <i>He must&#x2019;ve been raised by one strict</i> sheshan, Torin thought, grabbing her service uniform and ducking into the bathroom. It had taken most of her nine years in the Corps to achieve that precise a fold, regardless of distraction.</p><p>When she emerged a few moments later, fully dressed, all she could see of her companion was a lithe lump under the blanket and a moving fringe of uncovered hair. Relieved, she moved silently toward the door, pausing only long enough to turn off the lights. A di&#x2019;Taykan considered, &#x201c;<i>Once more before breakfast?</i>&#x201d; to be a reasonable substitute for &#x201c;<i>Good morning.</i>&#x201d; And, with no time to spare, she was just as happy not to have to test her willpower.</p><p>Outside in the corridor, the familiar &#x201c;something&#x2019;s leaking somewhere&#x201d; smell of the station&#x2019;s recycled air drove the last of the pheromone-induced haze from her head.</p><p><i>*0547*</i> her implant announced when she prodded. Thirteen minutes before her liberty ended and her flasher came back up on screen. Thirteen minutes to get to a part of the station that wouldn&#x2019;t incite prurient speculation among the duty staff.</p><p>&#x201c;I should&#x2019;ve reset wake-up for five. What was I <i>thinking?</i>&#x201d; she muttered, diving into the vertical&#x2014;fortunately empty at this hour&#x2014;and free-falling two levels. Grabbing a handhold, she swung out onto the lock level. Easy answer, actually. She&#x2019;d been thinking that she needed to forget the carnage, forget those they lost limping back to the station on a ship that had won its battle but nearly lost its own little slice of the war, forget the messages she&#x2019;d sent to family and friends, and forget that new faces, always new faces, would soon be arriving to replace those they&#x2019;d lost.</p><p>And she had been able to forget. For a while.</p><p>A di&#x2019;Taykan wouldn&#x2019;t feel used. She didn&#x2019;t think they could.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Considering the time, it was a good thing station guest quarters were on the same side of the core as the barracks. Another vertical, another lock, and she was in NCO country.</p><p><i>*0600.*</i></p><p>Heading for her own quarters, Staff Sergeant Torin Kerr had her implant scan the night&#x2019;s reports for any of the names she kept flagged. Apparently, no one had died and no one had gotten arrested.</p><p>Things hadn&#x2019;t fallen apart while she was gone.</p><p>No harm done, and it wasn&#x2019;t as if she&#x2019;d ever see that particular di&#x2019;Taykan again...</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>At 0758, showered, changed, and carrying her slate, Torin approached the captain&#x2019;s door, turning over the possible reasons he&#x2019;d moved their morning meeting up an hour. As senior surviving NCO, she&#x2019;d been his acting First Sergeant since the battered remnant of Sh&#x2019;quo Company had arrived back at the station. Clearly that wasn&#x2019;t going to last, but it was unlikely Battalion HQ would send out a new First before the recruits needed to bring the company up to strength&#x2014;unlikely but possible, she admitted after a moment&#x2019;s reflection. Battalion HQ had shown what could only be called <i>unique</i> leadership in the past.</p><p>It was also possible that they were promoting her and the captain needed to tell her in time for her to make the 1000 shuttle. With a war on, it didn&#x2019;t take long to make sergeant, but after that, promotions tended to slow down, common wisdom suggesting that by the time a grunt got that third chevron, they&#x2019;d learned to duck. Still, with the company losing their First, there&#x2019;d be a gunny moving up and that&#x2019;d leave room for her.</p><p>She&#x2019;d have rather had First Sergeant Chigma back. The few Krai who went into the Marines usually opted for armored platoons or air support&#x2014;their feet just weren&#x2019;t built for infantry&#x2014;so those few who not only chose to be grunts but rose in the ranks left big shoes to fill in more than merely the literal sense. Unfortunately, since Chigma had ended up on the wrong end of an enemy projectile weapon their last planetfall...</p><p><i>*0759.*</i></p><p>Maybe Med-op had scheduled the captain for new treatments at nine.</p><p><i>Look at the bright side</i>, she reminded herself, laying her palm against the sensor pad centered in the door. <i>We&#x2019;re in no condition to be sent back out.</i></p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>The presence of a two star general in the captain&#x2019;s office did not come as a pleasant surprise. In Torin&#x2019;s experience, when generals ignored the chain of command to speak directly to sergeants, it was never good news. And smiling generals were the worst kind.</p><p>&#x201c;You must be Staff Sergeant Kerr.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded as he stepped forward. &#x201c;Sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Staff, this is General Morris.&#x201d; The regeneration tank around the lower half of his left leg kept Captain Rose from standing, but his voice, unexpectedly deep from such a small man, was enough to stop the general&#x2019;s advance. &#x201c;He has new orders for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Say rather an opportunity. But don&#x2019;t let me interrupt.&#x201d; He gestured at the slate under Torin&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;I understand you&#x2019;ve been acting First. We&#x2019;ll talk once you&#x2019;ve finished your morning report.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sir.&#x201d; Her face expressionless under the general&#x2019;s smiling regard, she crossed to the desk and downloaded the relevant files. Right now, with no more information to go on than his smile and two dozen words delivered in an annoying <i>we&#x2019;re-all-in-this-together</i> tone, she&#x2019;d be willing to bet that, first of all, General Morris had never seen combat and, second, that Captain Rose liked him even less than she did. As the captain appeared to know what was going on, her sense of impending disaster strengthened.</p><p>&#x201c;Doctorow&#x2019;s no longer critical?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Regained consciousness at 0300.

After something like that, I expect my people to need to blow off.&#x201d;</p><p>The general&#x2019;s broad cheeks flushed nearly maroon. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been on station for six days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Half of us have.

And I lost good people.&#x201d; The quiet reminder drew Torin&#x2019;s gaze down to the captain&#x2019;s face, and she frowned slightly. He looked tired; his fair skin had developed a grayish cast, and there were dark circles under his eyes. Had they been alone, she&#x2019;d have asked how the regeneration was going; as it was, she made a mental note to check his condition with Med-op as soon as possible. As acting First, he was as much her concern as the company.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Good people.&#x201d; General Morris straightened and cleared his throat. &#x201c;Which leads us nicely into what I&#x2019;m here for.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Oh, shit.

Then Sula ran away to live her dreams and Nel got married. Ten years later Sula returns and no one, least of all Nel, trusts her. SULA is the story of the fear that makes people accept self-pity; the fear that will not countenance escape and that justifies itself through myth and legend. Sula herself is cast as a witch and demon by the people who resent her strength. They attack her with the most pervasive weapon of all, the weapon of language and story. But Sula is a woman of power, a wayward force who challenges the smallness of a world that tries to hold her down.</p><p>In <i>Sula</i>, Toni Morrison, winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for literature, tells the story of two women--friends since childhood, separated in young adulthood, and reunited as grown women. Nel Wright grows up to become a wife and mother, happy to remain in her hometown of Medallion, Ohio. Sula Peace leaves Medallion to experience college, men, and life in the big city, an exceptional choice for a black woman to make in the late 1920s. <p>As girls, Nel and Sula are the best of friends, only children who find in each other a kindred spirit to share in each girl's loneliness and imagination. When they meet again as adults, it's clear that Nel has chosen a life of acceptance and accommodation, while Sula must fight to defend her seemingly unconventional choices and beliefs. But regardless of the physical and emotional distance that threatens this extraordinary friendship, the bond between the women remains unbreakable: "Her old friend had come home.... Sula, whose past she had lived through and with whom the present was a constant sharing of perceptions. Talking to Sula had always been a conversation with herself." </p><p>Lyrical and gripping, <i>Sula</i> is an honest look at the power of friendship amid a backdrop of family, love, race, and the human condition. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>Praise for Toni Morrison reading <b>Sula</b><p>"Toni Morrison's speaking voice contains the same musicality as her prose, and the combination of the two results in a nearly sublime experience." <br>- The Chicago Tribune</p><p>". . . it's a storyteller's voice - older than sound recording, older even than print itself." <br>-The Trenton Times</p><p>"Morrison's remarkable talent for storytelling naturally lends itself to the spoken word."<br> - The Arizona Republic<br></p></p><h2>Go Free or Die: A Story about Harriet Tubman (Creative Minds Biographies)</h2><p><p>For the first twenty-eight years of her life.

Grade 3-6 Ferris presents all the pertinent facts about her subjects, but in a narrative framework that includes invented dialogue, attributed emotions, and se lective highlighting of events. This makes for interesting, readable stories that still contain enough information for reports. Go Free or Die is the weaker of the two. It has some major discrepan cies with other sources, and traces Tub man's life only through her escape from slavery at age 28.

Surrounded by ranchers bent on wiping out coyotes and other pests with guns, poison, and other sophisticated weapons, Hyde instead actively encouraged the presence of predator and prey on his Oregon cattle ranch. He even built a dam to re-create an ancient lake. The result was a banner year: solar heat trapped by lake water moderated frosts, causing grasses and marsh plants to flourish. Because coyotes stayed well fed by small prey the new meadows supported, Hyde lost no calves to them. His beef fattened well on the natural forage, while insects were checked by birds the lake attracted. Readers will enjoy Hyde's graceful writing, good humor, and cogent arguments for working with, not against, nature. Laurie Tynan, Huntingdon Cty.

Attracted by the golden promise of California, they meet only with abject hostility, shame and destitution.</p><p>When <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> was published in 1939, America, still recovering from the Great Depression, came face to face with itself in a startling, lyrical way. John Steinbeck gathered the country's recent shames and devastations--the Hoovervilles, the desperate, dirty children, the dissolution of kin, the oppressive labor conditions--in the Joad family. Then he set them down on a westward-running road, local dialect and all, for the world to acknowledge. For this marvel of observation and perception, he won the Pulitzer in 1940.<p> The prize must have come, at least in part, because alongside the poverty and dispossession, Steinbeck chronicled the Joads' refusal, even inability, to let go of their faltering but unmistakable hold on human dignity. Witnessing their degeneration from Oklahoma farmers to a diminished band of migrant workers is nothing short of crushing. The Joads lose family members to death and cowardice as they go, and are challenged by everything from weather to the authorities to the California locals themselves. As Tom Joad puts it: "They're a-workin' away at our spirits. They're a tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl like a whipped bitch. They tryin' to break us. Why, Jesus Christ, Ma, they comes a time when the on'y way a fella can keep his decency is by takin' a sock at a cop. They're workin' on our decency."</p><p> The point, though, is that decency remains intact, if somewhat battle-scarred, and this, as much as the depression and the plight of the "Okies," is a part of American history. When the California of their dreams proves to be less than edenic, Ma tells Tom: "You got to have patience. Why, Tom--us people will go on livin' when all them people is gone. Why, Tom, we're the people that live. They ain't gonna wipe us out. Why, we're the people--we go on." It's almost as if she's talking about the very novel she inhabits, for Steinbeck's characters, more than most literary creations, do go on. They continue, now as much as ever, to illuminate and humanize an era for generations of readers who, thankfully, have no experiential point of reference for understanding the depression. The book's final, haunting image of Rose of Sharon--Rosasharn, as they call her--the eldest Joad daughter, forcing the milk intended for her stillborn baby onto a starving stranger, is a lesson on the grandest scale. "'You got to,'" she says, simply. And so do we all. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>A heart-wrenching full-cast adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by John Steinbeck, starring Jeffrey Donovan and Shirley Knight. Set during the Great Depression, The Grapes of Wrath tells the powerful story of the Joad family's trek from the dust bowl of Oklahoma to the promise of a new life in California. But what they find threatens to rip apart their lives, and sever the ties that bind them together.

She's fond of portraying characters who seem strangely comfortable living in emotional extremity. She never takes the safe route through a story; in fact, she'll choose the low road every time. The title story places a runaway girl in care of abandoned children. Where many writers would seek out some faint ray of redemption or hope, Gaitskill concentrates on the grime in the cracks of the linoleum. In "The Girl on the Plane," a bitter man confesses his participation in a brutal act to a stranger, but the confession brings no solace. These stories practically shake with tension. In the final long story of this collection, "The Wrong Thing," Gaitskill picks up the tale after the breaking point, as she gracefully illuminates the life of a woman piecing together the fragments of her sexual and emotional history. <i>Because They Wanted</i> not only fulfills the promise of her previous short-story collection <i>Bad Behavior</i> and the novel <i>Two Girls, Fat and Thin</i>, it takes us to a higher place.Mary Gaitskill is currently a visiting lecturer at the University of Houston.</p><h2>Mackenzie&#39;s Legacy: An Anthology (NYT Bestselling Author)</h2><p><br><br><em>Mackenzie's Mountain</em><br><br>Mary Elizabeth Potter is a self-appointed spinster with no illusions about love.

Bad.<br><br>Wolf Mackenzie spent a restless night, with the bright full moon throwing its silver light on the empty pillow beside him. His body ached with need, the sexual need of a healthy man, and the passing hours only intensified his frustration. Finally he got out of bed and walked naked to the window, his big body moving with fluid power. The wooden floor was icy beneath his bare feet but he welcomed the discomfort, for it cooled the undirected desire that heated his blood.<br><br>The colorless moonlight starkly etched the angles and planes of his face, living testimony to his heritage. Even more than the thick black hair worn long to touch his shoulders, even more than the heavy-lidded black eyes, his face proclaimed him Indian. It was in his high, prominent cheekbones and broad forehead, his thin lips and high-bridged nose. Less obvious, but just as fierce, was the Celtic heritage from his father, only one generation removed from the Scottish Highlands. It had refined the Indian features inherited from his mother into a face like a blade, as clean and sharply cut as it was strong. In his veins ran the blood of two of the most warlike peoples in the history of the world, Comanche and Celt. He had been a natural warrior, a fact soon discovered by the military when he had enlisted.<br><br>He was also a sensualist. He knew his own nature well, and though he controlled it, there were times when he needed a woman. He usually visited Julie Oakes at those times. She was a divorced woman, several years older, who lived in a small town fifty miles distant. Their arrangement had lasted five years; neither Wolf nor Julie was interested in marriage, but both had needs, and they liked each other. Wolf tried not to visit Julie too often, and he took care that he was never seen entering her house; he accepted the fact, unemotionally, that her neighbors would be outraged if they knew she slept with an Indian. And not just any Indian; a rape charge stuck to a man forever.<br><br>The next day was a Saturday. There would be the normal chores, and he had to pick up a load of fencing materials in Ruth, the small town just at the base of his mountain, but Saturday nights were traditionally for howling. He wouldn't howl, but he'd visit Julie and burn off his sexual tension in her bed.<br><br>The night was turning colder, and low heavy clouds were moving in. He watched until they obscured the moon, knowing they meant new snow. He didn't want to return to his empty bed. His face was impassive, but his loins ached. He needed a woman.<br><br>Mary Elizabeth Potter had numerous small chores to occupy her time that Saturday morning, but her conscience wouldn't let her rest until she had talked to Joe Mackenzie. The boy had dropped out of school two months before, a month before she had arrived to take the place of a teacher who had abruptly quit. No one had mentioned the boy to Mary, but she'd run across his school record, and curiosity had led her to read it. In the small town of Ruth, Wyoming, there weren't that many students in school, and she had thought she'd met them all. In fact, there were less than sixty students, but the graduation rate was almost one hundred percent, so any dropout was unusual. When she had read Joe Mackenzie's record, she'd been stunned. The boy had been at the <em>top </em>of his class, with straight A's in all subjects. Students who did poorly would get discouraged and drop out, but every teaching instinct she had was outraged that such an outstanding student would just quit. She had to talk to him, try to make him understand how important it was to his future that he continue his education. Sixteen was so young to make a mistake that would haunt him the rest of his life. She wouldn't be able to sleep at night until she had done her best to talk him into returning.<br><br>It had snowed again during the night and had turned bitterly cold. The cat meowed plaintively as it wound around her ankles, as if complaining about the weather. "I know, Woodrow," she consoled the animal. "The floor must be cold to your feet." She could sympathize. She didn't think her feet had been warm since she had moved to Wyoming.<br><br>Before another winter came, she promised herself, she would own a pair of warm, sturdy boots, fur-lined and waterproof, and she would stomp about in the snow as if she'd been doing it all her life, like a native. Actually she needed the boots now, but the expenses of moving had wiped out her cash reserves, and the teachings of her thrifty aunt prevented her from buying the boots on credit.<br><br>Woodrow meowed again as she put on the warmest, most sensible shoes she owned, the ones she privately called her "old maid schoolteacher shoes." Mary paused to scratch behind his ears, and his back arched in ecstasy. She had inherited him with the house, which the school board had arranged for her to live in; the cat, like the house, wasn't much. She had no idea how old Woodrow was, but both he and the house looked a little run-down. Mary had always resisted owning a cat&#x2014;it seemed the crowning touch to an old maid's life&#x2014;but finally her fate had caught up with her. She <em>was </em>an old maid. Now she owned a cat. And wore old maid shoes. The picture was complete.<br><br>"Water seeks its own level," she told the cat, who looked back at her with his unconcerned Egyptian gaze. "But what do you care? It doesn't hurt <em>you </em>that my personal water level seems to stop at sensible shoes and cats."<br><br>But as she looked in the mirror to make certain her hair was tidy, she sighed. Sensible shoes and cats were just her style, along with being pale, slight and nondescript. "Mousy" was a good word. Mary Elizabeth Potter had been born to be an old maid.<br><br>She was dressed as warmly as she could manage, unless she put on socks to wear with her sensible shoes, but she drew the line at that. Dainty white anklets with long ruffled skirts were one thing, but knee socks with a wool dress were something else entirely. She was willing to be dowdy for the sake of warmth; she was not willing to be tacky.<br><br>Well, there was no point in putting it off; it wasn't going to get any warmer until spring. Mary braced herself for the shock of cold air on a system that still expected the warmth of Savannah. She had left her tidy little nest in Georgia for the challenge of a tiny school in Wyoming, for the excitement of a different way of life; she even admitted to a small yearning for adventure, though of course she never allowed it to surface. But somehow, she hadn't taken the weather into account. She had been prepared for the snow, but not the bitter temperatures. No wonder there were so few students, she thought as she opened the door and gasped as the wind whipped at her. It was too cold for the adults to undress enough to do anything that might result in children!<br><br>She got snow in her sensible shoes when she walked to her car, a sensible two-door, midsize Chevrolet sedan, on which she had sensibly put a new set of snow tires when she had moved to Wyoming. According to the weather report on the radio that morning, the high would be seven degrees below zero. Mary sighed again for the weather she had left behind in Savannah; it was March now, and spring would be in full swing, with flowers blooming in a riot of colors.<br><br>But Wyoming was beautiful, in a wild, majestic way. The soaring mountains dwarfed the puny man-made dwellings, and she had been told that, come spring, the meadows would be carpeted in wildflowers, and the crystal-clear creeks would sing their own special song. Wyoming was a different world from Savannah, and she was just a transplanted magnolia who was having trouble getting acclimated.<br><br>She had gotten instructions on how to get to the Mackenzie residence, though the information had been reluctantly given. It puzzled her that no one seemed interested in the boy, because the people in the little town had been friendly and helpful to her. The most direct comment she had gotten had been from Mr. Hearst, the grocery-store owner, who had muttered that "the Mackenzies aren't worth your trouble." But Mary considered any child worth her trouble. She was a teacher, and she meant to teach.<br><br>As she got into her sensible car, she could see the mountain called Mackenzie's Mountain, as well as the narrow road that wound up its side like a ribbon, and she quailed inside. New snow tires notwithstanding, she wasn't a confident driver in this strange environment. Snow was... well, snow was <em>alien, </em>not that she'd let it stop her from doing what she had set her mind on doing.<br><br>She was already shivering so hard that she could barely fit the key into the ignition. It was so cold! It actually hurt her nose and lungs to inhale. Perhaps she should wait for better weather before attempting the drive. She looked at the mountain again. Maybe in June all of the snow would have melted... but Joe Mackenzie had already been out of school for two months. Maybe in June the gap would seem insurmountable to him, and he wouldn't make the effort. It might already be too late. She had to try, and she didn't dare let even another week go by.<br><br>It was her habit to give herself pep talks whenever she was pushing herself to do something she found difficult, so she muttered under her breath as she began the drive. "It won't seem so steep once I'm actually on the road. All uphill roads look vertical from a distance. It's a perfectly negotiable road, otherwise the Mackenzies wouldn't be able to get up and down, and if they can do it, I can do it." Well, perhaps she could do it. Driving on snow was an acquired skill, one she hadn't as yet mastered.<br><br>Determination kept her going. When she finally reached the mountain and the road tilted upward, her hands clenched on the steering wheel as she deliberately refrained from looking over the side at the increasing distance to the valley floor. Knowing how far it was possible for her to fall if she drove off the edge wouldn't help her at all; in Mary's opinion, that would be in the category of useless knowledge, of which she already had quite enough.<br><br>"I won't slide," she muttered. "I won't go fast enough to lose control. This is like the Ferris wheel. I was certain I was going to fall out, but I didn't." She had ridden the Ferris wheel once, when she'd been nine years old, and no one had ever been able to talk her into trying it again. Carousels were more her style.<br><br>"The Mackenzies won't mind if I talk to Joe," she reassured herself in an attempt to get her mind off the drive. "Maybe he had trouble with a girlfriend, and that's why he doesn't want to go to school. At his age, it's probably all blown over by now."<br><br>Actually the drive wasn't as bad as she'd feared. She began to breathe a little easier. The incline was more gradual than it had appeared, and she didn't think she had too much farther to go. The mountain wasn't as enormous as it had looked from the valley.<br><br>She was so intent on her driving that she didn't notice the red light appear on the dash. She had no warning of overheating until steam suddenly erupted from beneath the hood, the frigid air instantly converting the mist into ice crystals on the windshield. Mary instinctively hit the brakes, then uttered a discreet oath when the wheels began sliding. Quickly she lifted her foot from the brake pedal, and the tires found traction again, but she couldn't see. Closing her eyes, she prayed that she was still going in the right direction and let the car's weight slow it to a stop.<br><br>The engine was hissing and bellowing like a dragon. Shaking in reaction, she turned off the ignition and got out of the car, gasping as the wind lashed her like an icy whip. The hood release mechanism was stiff from the bitter cold, but finally yielded, and she raised the hood to see what had happened, on the grounds that it would be nice to know what was wrong with the car even if she couldn't fix it. It didn't take a mechanic to see the problem: one of the water hoses had split, and hot water was spitting fitfully from the break.<br><br>Instantly she recognized the precariousness of her position. She couldn't stay in the car, because she couldn't let the motor run to keep her warm. The road was a private one, and the Mackenzies might not leave their ranch at all that day, or that entire weekend. It was too far, and too cold, for her to walk back to her own house. Her only option was to walk to the Mackenzie ranch and pray it wasn't very far. Her feet were already numb.<br><br>She didn't let herself dwell on the thought that she might not make it to the Mackenzie ranch, either. Instead she began to walk steadily up the road and tried to ignore the snow that got inside her shoes with each step.<br><br>She rounded a curve and lost sight of her car, but when she looked ahead there was still no sign of a house, or even a barn. She felt alone, as if she had been dropped into the middle of a wilderness. There was only the mountain and the snow, the vast sky and herself. The silence was absolute. It hurt to walk, and she found that she was sliding her feet instead of picking them up. She had gone fewer than two hundred yards.<br><br>Her lips trembled as she hugged herself in an effort to retain her body's heat. Painful or not, she would just have to keep walking.<br><br>Then she heard the low growl of a powerful engine, and she stopped, relief welling in her so painfully that tears burned her eyes. She had a horror of crying in public and blinked them back. There was no sense in crying; she had been walking less than fifteen minutes and hadn't been in any real danger at all. It was just her overactive imagination, as usual. She shuffled through the snow to the side of the road, to get out of the way, and waited for the approaching vehicle.<br><br></p><h2>The Complete Stories, Vol. 1</h2><p>Forty-seven Isaac Asimov short stories.</p><p>The first book of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.ok of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.</p><h2>Charlton Heston: Hollywood&#39;s Last Icon</h2><p><p><strong>A <em>USA Today&nbsp;</em>New and Noteworthy Selection<em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>This is the definitive biography of one of the most iconic, complex and enduring legends of Hollywood&#x2019;s golden age, whose major presence in American film, radio, television, stage and theater lasted beyond the second half of the 20th Century, and whose classic films are known throughout the world. </p><p>Written by <em>New York Times</em> bestselling, prize-winning author Marc Eliot -&nbsp;<em>Cary Grant, Walt Disney, Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen, Jack Nicholson,</em>&nbsp;and others - with unprecedented access to the family, friends, and Heston&#x2019;s private papers, diaries, journal, writings and estate, he tells an unforgettable tale of an extraordinary life you may find difficult to put down.&nbsp;</p><p>Eliot's biography is rich with facts details and anecdotal material that bring to life the complex story of this most iconic of American popular cultural giants to illuminate Heston's greatest achievements and his personal failures.

Particularly his dream symbolism. But I&#x2019;ve seen dream analysis work. When &#x201c;in treatment&#x201d;&#x2014;that lovely euphemism for getting your head shrunk&#x2014;with the brilliant Dr. Willard Gaylin, I would come in with a mishmash of a dream and, feature by crazy feature, he would elucidate it. It was&#x2014;and can we now retire this word for at least a decade, young people?&#x2014;awesome.</p> <p>Some people claim they never dream. There are times when I wish I were one of them.</p> <p>There are two types of dream that rate, for me at least, the word &#x201c;nightmare.&#x201d; The buggers are the Actor&#x2019;s Dream and the Exam Dream. If you&#x2019;ve never endured either of these, count yourself lucky. Maybe I&#x2019;m getting your share.</p> <p>The question I can never find an answer to is the one that makes dreams so mysterious. When you watch a movie or read a story you don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s coming next. You&#x2019;re surprised by what happens as it unfolds. You know that someone wrote the book or made the movie.</p> <p>But who in hell is the author of the dream? How can it be anyone but you? But how can it be you if it&#x2019;s all new to you, if you don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s coming? Do you write the dream, then hide it from yourself, forget it, and then &#x201c;sit out front&#x201d; and watch it? Everything in it is a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant. And, unlike a book or film, you can&#x2019;t fast-forward to see how it comes out. So where does it come from? And who &#x201c;wrote&#x201d; it?</p> <p>(I apologize if I&#x2019;ve led you to think I have the answers.)</p> <p>What shows you the dream and at the same time blinds you to its source? The mechanism has to be ingeniously complex to pull this stunt off. But it seems that the complexity of the human brain is too, well, complex for that same brain to understand.</p> <p>A nice puzzle.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;ve ever met anyone who hasn&#x2019;t had the Exam Dream. (Do people who haven&#x2019;t been to school get this dream, or are they immune to the torture?)</p> <p>There you are in the classroom, trying desperately to get a peek at someone else&#x2019;s paper, but they&#x2019;ve just turned the page as you writhe in the realization that you forgot to study.</p> <p>Why, this far from one&#x2019;s education, does one (or at least I) still get the damned dream?</p> <p>Once I awoke in a sweat from it, walked around a little to shake it off, calmed down, and went back to sleep, only to be blindsided that same night by the Actor&#x2019;s Dream.</p> <p>Every actor gets it, even people who have only been in the school play. You&#x2019;re backstage, about to go on, and desperately trying to find a copy of the play to get at least your first line or two, but no one has a script. How did you get to opening night and fail to learn a single line?</p> <p>You&#x2019;re plagued with &#x201c;How did I do this to myself?&#x201d; and &#x201c;Am I even wearing the right costume?&#x201d; and &#x201c;Do I go out there and try to ad-lib a part I don&#x2019;t know, maybe getting a few lines right by chance?&#x201d; and &#x201c;In a moment I&#x2019;ll step out there and make an ass of myself, let down and embarrass my fellow actors, and probably be fired on the spot as they give people&#x2019;s money back.&#x201d; It goes on and on and won&#x2019;t let up on you.</p> <p>The merciful release at the much-too-late-in-coming realization &#x201c;Oh, thank God, it&#x2019;s a dream!&#x201d; leaves you limp.</p> <p>Freud, &#x201c;the Viennese quack&#x201d; (Nabokov), is said to have pointed out that the mental agony of an excruciating dream is always far worse than the real situation would be.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s true.</p> <p>Logic tells you that in waking real life you probably wouldn&#x2019;t get into the situation you lie there suffering and blaming yourself for. The rich variety of hateful anxiety dreams can be about anything: not having studied; having lost your passport in an unfamiliar land; getting hopelessly lost in the woods; being late for and unable to find your own wedding; having let your pet get lost; and the myriad other sleeping torture plots the mind is heir to.</p> <p>The psychic pain is acute. And even if these things did happen, awful as they would be, why must the psychic pain be ten times more excruciating in the dream than it would be in real life?</p> <p>Who does this to us? Who or what is the sadistic force operating on us here? It&#x2019;s hard to admit, but doesn&#x2019;t it have to be ourselves?</p> <p>Then why are we doing it to ourselves? What did we do to deserve it? And does it all stand for something about us that&#x2019;s so awful it has to be disguised as something else in the dream?</p> <p>Please have your answers to these questions on my desk by Friday. Neatness and clarity of presentation will count, and five points will be taken off for spelling.</p> <p>Time for a laugh here. I just remembered that the great Robert Benchley wrote, somewhere, a piece about that aspect of dreams that&#x2019;s common to most of them&#x2014;that nothing is quite itself as you know it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my house but it&#x2019;s not my house. It&#x2019;s my gray suit but it has wheels on it.&#x201d;</p> <p>Should you deem this subject worthy of a return visit, I&#x2019;ll expose the specific anxiety dreams I collected for a time from some famous people: Laurence Olivier, Rudolf Nureyev, others.

She is the author of <b>The Secret History of the Pink Carnation</b>.</p> <p> </p>Chapter One London, England, 2003 I bit my lip on an &#x201c;Are we there yet?&#x201d; <p>If ever silence was the better part of valor, now was the time. Palpable waves of annoyance emerged from the man beside me, thick enough to constitute an extra presence in the car. </p><p>Under the guise of inspecting my fingernails, I snuck another glance sideways at my car mate. From that level, all I could see was a pair of hands tense on the steering wheel. They were tanned and callused against the brown corduroy cuffs of his jacket, with a .ne dust�ing of blond hairs outlined by the late-afternoon sun, and the white scar of an old cut showing against the darker skin on his left hand. Large hands. Capable hands. Right now he was probably imagining them clasped around my neck. </p><p>And I don&#x2019;t mean in an amorous embrace. </p><p>I had not been part of Mr. Colin Selwick&#x2019;s weekend plans. I was the fly in his ointment, the rain on his parade. The fact that it was a very attractive parade and that I was very single at the moment was entirely beside the point. </p><p>If you&#x2019;re wondering what I was doing in a car bound for parts un�known with a relative stranger who would have liked nothing better than to drop me in a ditch&#x2014;well, I&#x2019;d like to say, so was I. But I knew exactly what I was doing. It all came down to, in a word, archives. </p><p>Admittedly, archives aren&#x2019;t usually a thing to set one&#x2019;s blood pounding, but they do when you&#x2019;re a fifth-year graduate student in pursuit of a dissertation, and your advisor has begun making ominous noises about conferences and job talks and the nasty things that happen to attenuated graduate students who haven&#x2019;t produced a pile of paper by their tenth year. From what I understand, they&#x2019;re quietly shuf.ed out of the Harvard history department by dead of night and fed to a relentless horde of academic-eating crocodiles. Or they wind up at law school. Either way, the point was clear. I had to rack up some primary sources, and I had to do it soon, before the crocodiles started getting restless. </p><p>There was a teensy little added incentive involved. The incentive had dark hair and brown eyes, and occupied an assistant professorship in the Gov department. His name was Grant. </p><p>I have, I realize, left out his most notable characteristic. He was a cheating slime. I say that entirely dispassionately. Anyone would agree that smooching a first-year grad student&#x2014;during my department&#x2019;s Christmas party, which he attended at my invitation&#x2014;is indisputable evidence of cheating slimedom. </p><p>All in all, there had never been a better time to conduct research abroad. </p><p>I didn&#x2019;t include the bit about Grant in my grant application. There is a certain amount of irony in that, isn&#x2019;t there? Grant...grant.... The fact that I found that grimly amusing just goes to show the pa�thetic state to which I had been reduced.</p><p> But if modern manhood had let me down, at least the past boasted brighter specimens. To wit, the Scarlet Pimpernel, the Purple Gen�tian, and the Pink Carnation, that dashing trio of spies who kept Napoleon in a froth of rage and the feminine population of England in another sort of froth entirely. </p><p>Of course, when I presented my grant proposal to my advisor, I left out any references to evil exes and the aesthetic properties of knee breeches. Instead, I spoke seriously about the impact of England&#x2019;s aristocratic agents on the conduct of the war with France, their influence on parliamentary politics, and the deeper cultural implications of espionage as a gendered construct. </p><p>But my real mission had little to do with Parliament or even the Pimpernel. I was after the Pink Carnation, the one spy who had never been unmasked. The Scarlet Pimpernel, immortalized by the Baroness Orczy, was known the world over as Sir Percy Blakeney, Baronet, possessor of a wide array of quizzing glasses and the most impeccably tied cravat in London. His less-known successor, the Purple Gentian, had carried on quite successfully for a number of years until he, too, had been undone by love, and blazoned before the international press as Lord Richard Selwick, dashing rake about town. The Pink Carnation remained a mystery, to the French and scholars alike. </p><p>But not to me. </p><p>I wish I could boast that I had cracked a code, or deciphered an an�cient text, or tracked an incomprehensible map to a hidden cache of papers. In fact, it was pure serendipity, disguised in the form of an elderly descendant of the Purple Gentian. Mrs. Selwick-Alderly had made me free of both her home and a vast collection of family papers. She didn&#x2019;t even ask for my firstborn child in return, which I understand is frequently the case with fairy godmothers in these sorts of situations. </p><p>The only drawback to this felicitous arrangement was Mrs. Selwick-Alderly&#x2019;s nephew, current owner of Selwick Hall, and self-appointed guardian of the family heritage. His name? Mr. Colin Selwick. </p><p>Yes, that Colin Selwick. </p><p>To say that Colin had been less than pleased at seeing me going through his aunt&#x2019;s papers would have been rather like saying that Henry VIII didn&#x2019;t have much luck with matrimony. If decapitations were still considered a valid way of settling domestic problems, my head would have been the first on his block. </p><p>Under the influence of either my charming personality or a stern talking-to from his aunt (I suspected the latter), Colin had begun to thaw to nearly human behavior. I must say, it was an impressive process. When he wasn&#x2019;t snapping insults at me, he had the sort of crinkly-eyed smile that made movie theaters full of women heave a collective sigh. If you liked the big, blond, sporting type. Personally, I went more for tall, dark, and intellectual myself. </p><p>Not that it was an issue. Any rapport we might have developed had rapidly disintegrated when Mrs. Selwick-Alderly suggested that Colin give me access to the family archives at Selwick Hall for the weekend. <i>Suggested</i> is putting it a bit mildly. <i>Railroaded</i> would be more to the point. The traffic gods hadn&#x2019;t done anything to help the situation. I had given up trying to make small talk somewhere along the A-23, where there had been an epic traffic jam involving a stalled-out car, an overturned lorry, and a tow truck that reached the scene of the crime and promptly broke down out of sympathy. </p><p>I cast another surreptitious glance in Colin&#x2019;s direction. </p><p>&#x201c;Would you stop looking at me like you&#x2019;re Red Riding Hood and I&#x2019;m the wolf?&#x201d; </p><p>Maybe it hadn&#x2019;t been all that surreptitious. </p><p>&#x201c;Why, Grandmother, what big archives you have?&#x201d; As an attempt at humor, it lacked something, but given that it was the first time my vocal cords had had any exercise over the past two hours, I was reasonably pleased with the result. </p><p>&#x201c;Do you ever think about anything else?&#x201d; asked Colin. It was the sort of question that from anyone else I would have construed as an invitation to flirtation. From Colin, it just sounded exasperated. </p><p>&#x201c;Not with a dissertation deadline looming.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We,&#x201d; he pronounced ominously, &#x201c;still have to discuss what exactly is going to go into your dissertation.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Mmmph,&#x201d; I said enigmatically. He had already made his feelings on that clear, and I saw no point in giving him the opportunity to reit�erate them. Less discussed, more easily ignored. It was time to change the subject. &#x201c;Wine gum?&#x201d; </p><p>Colin emitted a choked noise that might have been a laugh if allowed to grow up. His eyes met mine in the rearview mirror in an ex�pression that might have been, &#x201c;I like your nerve,&#x201d; or might have been &#x201c;Oh, God, who let this lunatic loose in my car and where can I dump her?&#x201d; </p><p>All he actually said was &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; and held out one large hand, palm up. </p><p>In the spirit of entente, I passed over the orange and .ipped a red one into his palm. Popping the despised orange into my own mouth, I sucked it meditatively, trying to think of a conversational gambit that wouldn&#x2019;t touch on forbidden topics. </p><p>Colin did it for me. &#x201c;If you look to your left,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you should be able to see the house.&#x201d; </p><p>I caught a brief, tantalizing glimpse of crenellated battlements looming above the trees like a lost set from a Frankenstein movie be�fore the car swung around a curve, bringing us into full view of the house. Built of a creamy-colored stone, the house was what the papers might call &#x201c;a stately pile,&#x201d; a square central section with the usual clas�sical adornments, with a smaller wing sticking out on either side of the central block. It was a perfectly normal eighteenth-century gentle-man&#x2019;s residence, and exactly what one would expect the Purple Gentian to have lived in. There were no battlements. </p><p>The car scraped to a halt in the circle of gravel that fronted the entrance. Not waiting to see if he was going to open the door for me, I grabbed the oversized tote in which I had crammed two days&#x2019; worth of weekend wear, and scrambled out of the door of the car before Colin could reach it, determined to be as obliging as possible. </p><p>My heels crunched on the gravel as I followed Colin to the house, the little pebbles doing nasty things to the leather of my stacked loafers. One would have expected assorted staff to be lining the halls, but instead the front hall was decidedly empty as Colin stepped aside to allow me in. The door snapped shut with a distinctly ominous clang. </p><p>&#x201c;You can just take me to the library and then forget all about me,&#x201d; I suggested helpfully. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t even know I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Were you planning to sleep in the library?&#x201d; he inquired with some amusement, his eyes going to the overnight bag on my arm. </p><p>&#x201c;Um . . . I hadn&#x2019;t really thought about it. I can sleep wherever.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d; </p><p>I could feel my face flaring with light like a high school fire alarm, and rapidly tried to ameliorate the situation. &#x201c;What I mean is, I&#x2019;m easy.&#x201d; </p><p>Urgh. Worser and worser, as Alice might say. There are times when I shouldn&#x2019;t be allowed out of the house without a muzzle. </p><p>&#x201c;Easy to have as a houseguest, I mean,&#x201d; I specified in a strangled voice, hoisting my bag farther up on my shoulder. </p><p>&#x201c;I think the hospitality of Selwick Hall can stretch to providing you a bed,&#x201d; commented Colin dryly, leading the way up a flight of stairs tucked away to one side of the hall. </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s nice to know. Very generous of you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Too much hassle clearing out the dungeons,&#x201d; explained Colin, twisting open a door not far from the landing, revealing a medium-sized room possessed of a dark four-poster bed. The walls were dark green, patterned with gold-tinted animals that looked like either dragons or gryphons, squatting on their haunches, stylized wings poking into the forequarters of the next beast over. He stepped aside to let me precede him. </p><p>Dumping my bag onto the bed, I turned back around to face Colin, who was still propping up the door. I shoved my hair out of my eyes. &#x201c;Thanks. Really. It&#x2019;s really nice of you to have me here.&#x201d; </p><p>Colin didn&#x2019;t mouth any of the usual platitudes about it being no problem, or being delighted to have me. Instead, he tipped his head in the direction of the hall and said, &#x201c;The loo is two doors down to your left, the hot water tends to cut out after ten minutes, and the .ush needs to be jiggled three times before it settles.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I said. He got points for honesty, at least. &#x201c;Got it. Loo on the left, two jiggles.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Three jiggles,&#x201d; Colin corrected. </p><p>&#x201c;Three,&#x201d; I repeated firmly, as though I was actually going to remember. I trailed along after Colin down the hallway. </p><p>&#x201c;Eloise?&#x201d; A few yards ahead, Colin was holding open a door at the end of the hall. </p><p>&#x201c;Sorry!&#x201d; I scurried down the length of the hall to catch up, plunging breathlessly through the doorway. Crossing my arms over my chest, I said, a little too heartily, &#x201c;So this is the library.&#x201d; </p><p>There certainly couldn&#x2019;t be any doubt on that score; never had a room so resembled popular preconception. The walls were paneled in rich, dark wood, although the .nish had worn off the edges in spots where books had scraped against the wood in passing one too many times. A whimsical iron staircase curved to the balcony, the steps narrowing into pie-shaped wedges that promised a broken neck to the unwary. I tilted my head back, dizzied by the sheer number of books, row upon row, more than the most devoted bibliophile could hope to consume in a lifetime of reading. In one corner, a pile of crumbling paperbacks&#x2014;James Bond, I noticed, squinting sideways, in splashy seventies covers&#x2014;struck a slightly incongruous note. I spotted a moldering pile of <i>Country Life</i> cheek by jowl with a complete set of Trevelyan&#x2019;s <i>History of England</i> in the original Victorian bindings. The air was rich with the smell of decaying paper and old leather bindings. </p><p>Downstairs, where I stood with Colin, the shelves made way for four tall windows, two to the east and two to the north, all hung with rich red draperies checked with blue, in the obverse of the red-flecked blue carpet. On the west wall, the bookshelves surrendered pride of place to a massive .replace, topped with a carved hood to make Ivanhoe proud, and large enough to roast a serf. </p><p>In short, the library was a Gothic fantasy. </p><p>My face fell. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not original.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No, you poor innocent,&#x201d; said Colin. &#x201c;The entire house was gutted not long before the turn of the century. The last century,&#x201d; he added pointedly. </p><p>&#x201c;Gutted?&#x201d; I bleated. </p><p>Oh, fine, I know it&#x2019;s silly, but I had harbored romantic images of walking where the Purple Gentian had walked, sitting at the desk where he had penned those hasty notes upon which the fate of the kingdom rested, viewing the kitchen where his meals had been prepared.... I made a disgusted face at myself. At this rate, I was only one step away from going through the Purple Gentian&#x2019;s garbage, hugging his discarded port bottles to my palpitating bosom. </p><p>&#x201c;Gutted,&#x201d; repeated Colin firmly. </p><p>&#x201c;The floor plan?&#x201d; I asked pathetically. </p><p>&#x201c;Entirely altered.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Damn.&#x201d; </p><p>The laugh lines at the corners of his mouth deepened. </p><p>&#x201c;I mean,&#x201d; I prevaricated, &#x201c;what a shame for posterity.&#x201d; </p><p>Colin raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s considered one of the great examples of the arts and crafts movement. Most of the wallpaper and drapes were designed by William Morris, and the old nursery has fireplace tiles by Burne-Jones.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The Pre-Raphaelites are distinctly overrated,&#x201d; I said bitterly. Colin strolled over to the window, hands behind his back. &#x201c;The gardens haven&#x2019;t been changed. You can always go for a stroll around the grounds if the Victorians begin to overwhelm you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That won&#x2019;t be necessary,&#x201d; I said, with as much dignity as I could muster. &#x201c;All I need is your archives.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said Colin briskly, turning away from the window. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get you set, then, shall we?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Do you have a muniments room?&#x201d; I asked, tagging along after him. </p><p>&#x201c;Nothing so grand.&#x201d; Colin strode straight towards one of the bookcases, causing me a momentary flutter of alarm. The books on the shelf certainly looked elderly&#x2014;at least, if the dust on the spines was anything to go by&#x2014;but they were all books. Printed matter. When Mrs. Selwick-Alderly had said there were records at Selwick Hall, she hadn&#x2019;t speci.ed what kind of records.

By the middle of the eighteenth century William Penn's "greene countrie town" was, after London, the largest city in the British Empire. The two most important documents in the history of the United States, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, were drafted and signed in Philadelphia. The city served off and on as the official capital of the young country until 1800, and was also the site of the first American university, hospital, medical college, bank, paper mill, zoo, sugar refinery, public school, and government mint. </p><p>In <i>First City</i>, acclaimed historian Gary B. Nash examines the complex process of memory making in this most historic of American cities. Though history is necessarily written from the evidence we have of the past, as Nash shows, rarely is that evidence preserved without intent, nor is it equally representative. Full of surprising anecdotes, <i>First City</i> reveals how Philadelphians&#x2014;from members of elite cultural institutions, such as historical societies and museums, to relatively anonymous groups, such as women, racial and religious minorities, and laboring people&#x2014;have participated in the very partisan activity of transmitting historical memory from one generation to the next.</p></p><p><b>Gary B.

Since winning her first race a little more than a year earlier, the unbeaten, unflappable Ruffian had literally raced her way into the hearts of a nation. One of those hearts belonged to <em>Newsday</em> turf reporter William Nack.<p>As a boy in Illinois, Nack had carried in his pocket a trading card of his hero, Swaps, the winner of the 1955 Kentucky Derby. As a young soldier in Vietnam, Nack tuned out the midnight bomb blasts by listening to racetrack broadcasts from Santa Anita. Now, fresh off the publication of his astonishing biography of Secretariat -- described by <em>Seabiscuit</em> author Laura Hillenbrand as "the gold standard of horse books" -- he found himself smitten once again.</p><p>But tragedy struck that summer's day at Belmont Park. After charging from the gate, Ruffian stumbled and shattered her right foreleg. She had to be put down. Nack's heartbreaking run with thoroughbred racing's most famous filly will soon be immortalized in a made-for-TV movie to be broadcast on ESPN and ABC. In this moving, lyrical memoir, he relives the afternoon that forever changed his love affair with the track.</p></p><p>William Nack is the author of <i>Secretariat: The Making of a Champion</i>and <i>My Turf: Horses, Boxers, Blood Money, and the Sporting Life</i>.

With the same wide smile, winning charm, and vigorous demeanor, Ted possessed limitless potential, with even the White House within his reach.&nbsp;<br><br>In the First World War, Ted braved gunfire and gas attacks in France to lead his unit into battle. Yet even after returning home a hero, he was unable to meet the expectations of a public that wanted a man just like his father. A diplomat, writer, and man of great adventure, Ted remained frustrated by his lack of success in the world of politics, witnessing instead the rise of his cousin, Franklin, to the office that had once seemed his for the taking.<br><br>Then, with World War II looming, Ted reenlisted. In his mid-fifties with a gimpy leg and a heart condition, he was well past his prime, but his insistence to be in the thick of combat proved a vital asset. Paired with the irascible Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr., Ted soon distinguished himself as a front-line general in a campaign that often brought him into conflict with another hard fighter, George Patton. On D-Day, Ted became the oldest soldier and the only general in the Allied forces to storm the beach in the first wave, hobbling across the sand with his cane in one hand and a pistol in the other. His valor and leadership on Utah Beach became the stuff of legends&#x2014;and earned him the Medal of Honor.<br><br><i>His Father's Son </i>delves into the life of a man as courageous, colorful, and unwavering as any of the Roosevelt clan, and offers up a definitive portrait of one of America&#x2019;s greatest military heroes.<br><br><b>INCLUDES PHOTOS</b></p><p><b>Tim Brady</b> is an award-winning writer whose works include <i>Twelve Desperate Miles</i> and <i>A Death in San Pietro</i>.

Does color have an effect on our feelings? The phenomenon of color is examined in extraordinary new ways in John Gage's latest book. His pioneering study is informed by the conviction that color is a contingent, historical occurrence whose meaning, like language, lies in the particular contexts in which it is experienced and interpreted.<br><br>Gage covers topics as diverse as the optical mixing techniques implicit in mosaic; medieval color-symbolism; the equipment of the manuscript illuminator's workshop, the color languages and color practices of Latin America at the time of the Spanish Conquest; the earliest history of the prism; and the color ideas of Goethe and Runge, Blake and Turner, Seurat and Matisse.<br><br>From the perspective of the history of science, Gage considers the bearing of Newton's optical discoveries on painting, the chemist Chevreul's contact with painters and the growing interest of experimental psychologists in the topic of color in the late nineteenth century, particularly in relation to synaesthesia. He includes an invaluable overview of the twentieth-century literature that bears on the historical interpretation of color in art.

For the being-time.<p>YA-Chunky Rice is an anthropomorphic turtle who follows his urge to move on, leaving behind lovesick Dandele, a bug-eyed mouse, and a dreamy longshoreman. Chunky books passage on a barely seaworthy craft piloted by a shady skipper. Conjoined twins Ruth and Livonia are also on board. Back on shore, Dandele sends bottled missives out to sea and the longshoreman's injured pet bird, Merle, heals and regains flight. Thompson presents this bittersweet and engaging story in black-and-white panels that flow and tip into one another, giving the story motion that is reminiscent of the ocean against Chunky's boat and at Dandele's feet. The narrative intersperses past and present so that each character's motives become clear. Solid storytelling is expanded by the images, resulting in a fully realized literary work. The sea captain's posturing is fittingly retrograde and the twins are, by turns, self-exploitive and just plain folks. Chunky, Dandele, the longshoreman, and Merle, however, are unremitting winners.

Presented with a secret coded message, he deciphers it for Roosevelt, and soon wishes he hadn't.<br><br> Returning to Washington, he is assigned to follow up on the secret message and uncover the extent of Cuban revolutionary activities between Florida and Cuba, along with investigating rumors of Spanish government agents operating in Key West. <br><br>The investigation takes Wake to places he thought he knew so well: Havana, Key West, Tampa, and the islands of Florida's southwest coast. But the further he delves, the more he realizes how much he doesn't know, and is drawn inexorably into the center of the most catastrophic event in Key West history, when over half the city was destroyed.

Macomber is an internationally recognized, award-winning maritime writer, lecturer, and television commentator. He is the author of the acclaimed Honor Series of naval novels and is proud to have readers in ten countries. His awards include the Florida Genealogy Society&#39;s Outstanding Achievement Award for his nonfiction work on Florida&#39;s maritime history, the Patrick Smith Literary Award for Best Historical Novel of Florida (At the Edge of Honor), and the John Esten Cooke Literary Award for Best Work in Southern Fiction (Point of Honor). He is the guest author at regional and international book festivals and was named by Florida Monthly magazine as one of the 22 Most Intriguing Floridians of 2006. His sixth novel, A Different Kind of Honor, won the highest national honor in his genre: the American Library Association&#39;s 2008 W. Y. Boyd Literary Award for Excellence in Military Fiction. Each year Macomber travels approximately 15,000 sea miles around the globe, giving lectures and researching his novels.The eighth volume of the Honor series, which follows the career of an American naval intelligence officer, Commander Peter Wake, is set in 1886. The story begins in New York City, where a meeting with naval historian and rising politico Theodore Roosevelt sets in motion a chain of events that take Wake to Cuba, where he risks his life trying to put a lid on revolutionaries operating between Cuba and Florida. Faithful readers might recall that, with the seventh entry in the series (The Honored Dead, 2009), the author switched literary gears, shifting from third-person to first-person narrative. He continues that approach here, presenting the story as though it were written by Wake himself, years after the events. This device removes the element of immediacy (we know the story took place nearly a decade ago, so reducing suspense) but adds depth to Wake&#x2019;s character, allowing us to see more of what goes on beneath his surface. A solid entry in this popular series. --David Pitt</p><h2>Lion in the Valley</h2><p><p>The 1895-96 season promises to be an exceptional one for Amelia Peabody, her dashing Egyptologist husband, Radcliffe Emerson, and their precocious (some might say rambunctious) eight-year-old son, Ramses.

Both men, already notorious iconoclasts within their respective agencies, were assigned to seduce the other into betraying his country in the urgent final days of the Cold War, but instead the men ended up becoming the best of friends-blood brothers.

Murderous and torturous medical experiments. The "euthanasia" of hundreds of thousands of people with mental or physical disabilities. Widespread sterilization of "the unfit." Nazi doctors committed these and countless other atrocities as part of Hitler's warped quest to create a German master race. Robert Proctor recently made the explosive discovery, however, that Nazi Germany was also decades ahead of other countries in promoting health reforms that we today regard as progressive and socially responsible. Most startling, Nazi scientists were the first to definitively link lung cancer and cigarette smoking. Proctor explores the controversial and troubling questions that such findings raise: Were the Nazis more complex morally than we thought? Can good science come from an evil regime? What might this reveal about health activism in our own society? Proctor argues that we must view Hitler's Germany more subtly than we have in the past. But he also concludes that the Nazis' forward-looking health activism ultimately came from the same twisted root as their medical crimes: the ideal of a sanitary racial utopia reserved exclusively for pure and healthy Germans.</p><br><p> Author of an earlier groundbreaking work on Nazi medical horrors, Proctor began this book after discovering documents showing that the Nazis conducted the most aggressive antismoking campaign in modern history. Further research revealed that Hitler's government passed a wide range of public health measures, including restrictions on asbestos, radiation, pesticides, and food dyes. Nazi health officials introduced strict occupational health and safety standards, and promoted such foods as whole-grain bread and soybeans. These policies went hand in hand with health propaganda that, for example, idealized the F�hrer's body and his nonsmoking, vegetarian lifestyle. Proctor shows that cancer also became an important social metaphor, as the Nazis portrayed Jews and other "enemies of the Volk" as tumors that must be eliminated from the German body politic.</p><br><p> This is a disturbing and profoundly important book. It is only by appreciating the connections between the "normal" and the "monstrous" aspects of Nazi science and policy, Proctor reveals, that we can fully understand not just the horror of fascism, but also its deep and seductive appeal even to otherwise right-thinking Germans.</p></p><p>Familiar as we are with the horrific history of Nazi medicine and science, it may come as a surprise to learn that the Nazi war against cancer was the most aggressive in the world. Robert N. Proctor's thought-provoking book, <i>The Nazi War on Cancer</i> recounts this little-known story. The Nazis were very concerned about protecting the health of the "Volk." Cancer was seen as a growing threat--and perhaps even held a special place in Adolf Hitler's imagination (his mother, Klara, died from breast cancer in 1907). The Nazi doctors fought their war against cancer on many fronts, battling environmental and workplace hazards (restrictions on the use of asbestos) and recommending food standards (bans on carcinogenic pesticides and food dyes) and early detection ("men were advised to get their colons checked as often as they would check the engines of their cars..."). Armed with the world's most sophisticated tobacco-disease epidemiology--they were the first to link smoking to lung cancer definitively--Nazi doctors were especially passionate about the hazards of tobacco. Hitler himself was a devout nonsmoker, and credited his political success to kicking the habit. Proctor does an excellent job of charting these anticancer efforts--part of what he terms "the 'flip side' of fascism"--and, along the way, touches on some unsettling issues. Can an immoral regime promote and produce morally responsible science? Or, in Proctor's words, "Do we look at history differently when we learn that ... Nazi health officials worried about asbestos-induced lung cancer? I think we do. We learn that Nazism was a more subtle phenomenon than we commonly imagine, more seductive, more plausible."<p> Proctor is no apologist--one of his earlier books, <i>Racial Hygiene</i> is a scathing account of Nazi atrocities--but he clearly wants to engage in the complex moral discussions surrounding the fascist production of science and Holocaust studies. Proctor's thorough research, excellent examples, and dozens of illustrations are complemented by his authoritative prose. <i>The Nazi War on Cancer</i> is a fine addition to the literature on both the Holocaust and the history of medicine. <i>--C.B. Delaney</i></p><br> <p>"Robert Proctor is an outstanding historian of science and an outstanding historian of the Third Reich. By establishing Nazism's pioneering contributions in the areas of preventive medicine, environmentalism, and public health, he takes us right to the heart of the most difficult questions in the analysis of fascism. His treatment of smoking and cancer will be a revelation. This book troubles the politics and ethics of historical interpretation in the very best ways."<b>--Geoff Eley, author of <i>Reshaping the German Right: Radical Nationalism</i> and <i>Political Change after Bismarck</i><br> </b><br> </p> <br> <p>"Racily and wittily written, Proctor's interesting book is a brilliant demonstration of how marginal the Nazi past has become to contemporary health issues. A conclusion long since obvious to the former inhabitants of Bosnia or Rwanda, shot or hacked to death, in the very long shadow of the Holocaust."<b>--Michael Burleigh, author of <i>Ethics and Extermination: Reflections on Nazi Genocide</i><br> </b><br> </p> <br> <p>"A profound and provocative analysis of the very essence of medical research and health policy. While Robert Proctor focuses on cancer research in Nazi Germany, his book is a detailed examination of the basic value system underlying medical research and public health policy. This unsettling and fascinating account is a 'must read' for every medical scientist."<b>--William E. Seidelman, M.D., University of Toronto</b><br> </p> <br> <p>"This book is a major contribution to the history of science and medicine in the Nazi era. Nazism emerges as a kind of vast hygienic experiment that tried to create an exclusionist utopia, by using both 'good science' and laudable health drives, along with murderous practices aimed at the Jews and others deemed to be 'unworthy of life.' The book should be of interest to anyone concerned about the ethical, political, and social implications of modern science."<b>--Robert Gellately, author of <i>The Gestapo and German Society: Enforcing Racial Policy</i><br> </b><br> </p> <br> <p>"Robert Proctor has once again produced a brilliant volume that will both fascinate and infuriate readers.... Just as he did in his previous book <i>Racial Hygiene</i> Proctor's analysis tears at the very fabric of our belief that good science is moral science. ...This book will force all of us to sit up and think about the consequences of our actions and our moral responsibilities to account for just what we are doing in the name of scientific neutrality and objectivity."<b>--David Rosner, author of <i>Deadly Dust: Silicosis and the Politics of Occupational Disease in Twentieth Century America</i><br> </b><br> </p> <br> <p>"Professor Proctor has written a compelling and wonderfully readable account of how Nazi physicians confronted cancer. Sophisticated research went with racial megalomania, as German researchers targeted diet, occupation, smoking, and radium as cancer-inducing. Understanding the Nazi politics of medical research and disease eradication is both haunting and instructive for modern efforts to overcome cancer."<b>--Paul Weindling, author of <i>Health, Race and German Politics between National Unification and Nazism, 1870-1945</i><br> </b><br> </p> <br> <p>"Proctor's book should fundamentally alter the way we view science under the swastika. Without minimizing either the crimes of the Nazi regime or the complexity of its internal politics, Proctor shows that National Socialist health initiatives ran the entire spectrum from barbaric to benign. This should be essential reading, not just for historians of science and medicine, but for anyone interested in the history of the Third Reich."<b>--Diane Paul, author of <i>Controlling Human Heredity: 1865 to the Present</i> and <i>The Politics of Heredity: Essays on Eugenics, Biomedicine, and the Nature-Nurture Debate</i><br> </b><br> </p> <br> <p>"A fascinating account of medical and public-health ideas and policies in Nazi Germany. Its ironic emphasis on the--in retrospect--'rational' aspects of Hitler-era attitudes toward environmental contaminants, tobacco, and diet underlines the complex and contingent relationships among medicine, ideology, science, and policy."<b>--Charles Rosenberg, author of <i>Explaining Epidemics</i><br> </b><br> </p> <br> <p>"Lively prose and clear organization make this a wonderful book. <i>The Nazi War on Cancer</i> makes a major contribution to the field of Nazi history, with its attention to 'progressive' concerns within repressive and racialized settings. Rather than 'normalizing' evil, Proctor refines it in his sustained discussions of the ethical paradoxes he has encountered in his research."<b>--Claudia Koonz, Duke University</b><br> </p> <br> <p>"This book is interesting, informative, original, well-researched and well-written, and critical yet balanced in its judgments. It breaks new ground, and should attract considerable interest among and beyond historians of science, medicine, and National Socialism."<b>--Mark Walker, Union College</b><br> </p> <br> <p>"This book is interesting, informative, original, well-researched and well-written, and critical yet balanced in its judgments.

Home to nearly seventy percent of our nation's coral reefs, known as the "rainforests of the sea," the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands is a remarkable ecosystem that supports a vast array of interdependent native plants and animals that have evolved in this habitat over millions of years, many existing nowhere else on the planet.<br><br>The result is <i>Archipelago.</i> With its more than 300 stunning images, the book illustrates the spectacular diversity of these ocean and island creatures, as well as profiles many of the people dedicated to the preservation of this habitat. The inaccessibility of these islands and the need to protect them means that few people will ever be able to visit them in person, though now, for the first time, the area's inhabitants are available for all the world to see through this important body of work. In conjunction with the publication of Archipelago, exhibitions of these photographs will be mounted in Honolulu and Washington, and will then travel to venues around the country throughout 2006.</p><p>David Liittschwager and Susan Middleton are well known internationally for their arresting portraits of endangered North American plants and animals. They have published three books, and they won an Emmy in 1997 for the National Geographic television documentary <i>America's Endangered Species: Don't Say Goodbye.</i> They have an active lecture schedule across the U.S., and their work has appeared in publications the world over and in many noted scientific works as well.

This great work is set on a huge generation starship in the same future as the classic Book of the New Sun. The story of Patera Silk, a devout priest whose destiny is wrapped up with the gods he serves, takes place within the Whorl, a vast, cylindrical starship that has traveled for generations and is crumbling into disrepair. Through a strange and amazing series of events, Silk finds himself descending to base thievery, running afoul of a notorious crime lord, befriending a cyborg soldier, and encountering at least one of the gods of Mainframe.</p><p></p><h2>Among the Bears: Raising Orphaned Cubs in the Wild</h2><p><br>In the spring of 1993, Benjamin Kilham, a naturalist who lives in the woodlands of New Hampshire, began raising a pair of orphaned wild black bears. The experience changed his life. <br><br>While spending thousands of hours with the cubs, Kilham discovered unknown facets of bear behavior that have radically revised our understanding of animal behavior. Now widely recognized for his contributions to wildlife science, Kilham reveals that bears are altruistic and cooperate with unrelated, even unknown individuals, while our closer relatives, the supposedly more highly evolved chimps, cooperate only within troops of recognizable members. Beyond the natural history, he introduces individual bears who become enthralling and memorable characters.<br><br></p><p>When naturalist Kilham was asked to take in two orphaned black bear cubs, the conventional wisdom was that he would end up with 200-pound brutes too dependent to leave home. So Kilham decided to try his own unconventional method--he raised them in their natural habitat, surrounded by the wild bear-filled woods of New Hampshire. As their bear mother, he was given an unprecedented look into the lives of bears and what he observed turns bear stereotypes on their head. Black bears exhibit behaviors thought to be found only in humans and great apes, such as an intricate system of communication and cooperation, insight, planning, deception, and even ethics, like fair play, empathy, and altruism (qualities not found in apes). Kilham, who has now raised 26 cubs, is an intrepid bear mom, and a humble and delightful storyteller. This is an irresistible story of some of the most endearing rogues ever encountered. <i>--Lesley Reed</i><br><b>Benjamin Kilham </b>is a woodsman and naturalist who over the past twenty-five years has discovered and then field-tested a new, exciting wildlife biology. <b>Ed Gray</b> is a naturalist writer and founder of <i>Gray's Sporting Journal</i>.

For the first time, his story will be told in Brett Morgen&#x2019;s Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, a fully authorized feature documentary that in 2015 will be released theatrically around the world by Universal Pictures and shown exclusively by HBO in the United States. Brett Morgen, the Oscar�-nominated filmmaker behind acclaimed documentaries&#x2014;such as the HBO presentation Crossfire Hurricane, which celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the Rolling Stones, and The Kid Stays in the Picture&#x2014;is writer, director, and producer of Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck. Visual artist Frances Bean Cobain, Cobain&#x2019;s daughter, is executive producer. This riveting book will accompany Morgen&#x2019;s highly anticipated documentary and delve further into the material created for the film, presenting an illuminating and honest portrait of the Nirvana frontman that captures the contradictions that made up his character. The book is composed of the extended versions of the exclusive interviews featured in the film. The book will also showcase the film&#x2019;s incredible visuals with a mixture of animation stills, rare photography, and other treasures from Kurt Cobain&#x2019;s personal archive. Director Brett Morgen will also offer his personal thoughts on the creation of the film and the need to shatter the mythos that surrounds Cobain.

Included are down-to-earth descriptions as well as detailed photos and drawings. In addition, a large selection of project photos illustrates the amazing work that has been produced by craftsmen using small but capable miniature machine tools. Though the tools used in the examples highlight the small end of the size scale in machining, the theories and practices can be applied to metal working on machines of any size. <p>Whether you're a newly graduated engineer or a beginning machinist, this book will help you gather some real, practical knowledge of how machines and machinists actually go about working with metal. This isn't theory, but rather it details "real world" practices and gives a good insight into the challenges faced by machinists. Too often, good craftsmen are stopped from venturing forth because the only information available shows just the technically perfect way to do things rather than the simple, practical methods everyone really uses. For those wishing to design and build their first metal parts, it is a perfect starting point, as it highlights the fun that comes from making small projects of precision and beauty.</p></p><p>The information gathered for the book didn't come from a college education or a library. It came from a lifetime of experience in the real world of machining. It came the hard way at the expense of busted knuckles, broken taps and scrapped parts. Joe Martin now owns and manages a successful company that manufactures Sherline miniature machine tools, but he started in a small shop with old tools and no money. Being a hobbyist as well, he is familiar with the needs of both the home shop machinist and the commercial manufacturer. He is in the unique position to be able to offer a practical perspective on the equipment and processes of machining at both extremes...from intricate miniature machining projects to full size shop production tools. <p><i>Tabletop Machining</i> has been very successful and is now in its third printing. This has given the author the opportunity to fine-tune the copy to the highest level of quality. Any typographical errors found in the first printing have been eliminated.</p>Joe Martin grew up in New England and entered the building trades straight out of high school. He worked on many construction jobs around the country while pursuing his hobby of building and flying radio controlled aircraft on the side. He and a group of friends began the sport of Formula One model aircraft racing and Joe became one of the sport's early champions. His hobby eventually led him from the construction trades into manufacturing where he owned several companies producing products for the hobby markets. While working in that industry, he used a small, borrowed Unimat lathe to help complete a contract to design a joystick to test-fly the lunar lander for NASA. Years later, he came across a chance to become the United States distributor for the Australian-built Sherline miniature machine tool line. He knew it was a well-designed tool that eliminated all the weaknesses of the Unimat he had used before and felt there was a good market for it here. An early contract with Sears got the business off to a good start. He started out importing the machines from Australia, but wound up obtaining exclusive manufacturing rights to the Sherline tool line. In the process, he built a business from a few worn out, used tools in a rented industrial space to ownership of a large factory with over a million dollars worth of state-of-the-art computer controlled production machines. <p>Joe is still a hobbyist at heart and enjoys building and flying radio-controlled aircraft. The general public may have an image of a model builder as a stay-at-home nerd, but Joe has expanded his hobbies to include windsurfing, sailboat and automobile racing. Never one to be a spectator in life, he immerses himself fully in every job or hobby he takes on. He brings to this book the ability to draw upon many experiences for comparisons. His respect for the achievements of hobbyists and builders has also let him to sponsor contests and a Foundation to reward craftsmanship. That competition over the years has led to an excellent resource of photos of outstanding projects. There are very few people who could combine the photo resources, experience and knowledge he brings to this book.</p></p><h2>USGA Golf Rules Illustrated 2016: The Official Illustrated Guide to the Rules of Golf</h2><p><br>This book contains all the Rules of the game as revised 1st January, 2016, together with over 100 illustrations designed to provide easier understanding of those situations that cause difficulties for golfers.<br><br>This essential reference book gives guidance on every situation a player may come across including bunkers, water hazards, loose impediments, casual water and much more.

Still, math-friendly readers looking for a substantial and possibly even thrillingly difficult intellectual experience should pick up a copy (carefully--it's over a thousand pages long and weighs nearly 4 pounds) and start at the beginning, where Penrose sets out his purpose: to describe "the search for the underlying principles that govern the behavior of our universe." Beginning with the deceptively simple geometry of Pythagoras and the Greeks, Penrose guides readers through the fundamentals--the incontrovertible bricks that hold up the fanciful mathematical structures of later chapters. From such theoretical delights as complex-number calculus, Riemann surfaces, and Clifford bundles, the tour takes us quickly on to the nature of spacetime. The bulk of the book is then devoted to quantum physics, cosmological theories (including Penrose's favored ideas about string theory and universal inflation), and what we know about how the universe is held together. For physicists, mathematicians, and advanced students, <i>The Road to Reality</i> is an essential field guide to the universe. For enthusiastic amateurs, the book is a project to tackle a bit at a time, one with unimaginable intellectual rewards. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>This is arguably the most important work of science, aimed at the general reader, to be published in living memory. <br> <br>This 1000-page guide to the universe aims to provide a comprehensive account of our present understanding of the physical universe, and the essentials of its underlying mathematical theory. It attempts to convey an overall understanding -- a feeling for the deep beauty and philosophical connotations of the subject, as well as of its intricate logical interconnections. <br> <br>Clearly, a work of this nature is challenging, but no particular mathematical knowledge on the part of the reader is assumed, the early chapters providing the essential mathematical background for the physical theories described in the remainder of the book. There is also enough descriptive material to carry the less mathematically inclined reader through, as well as some 450-500, mostly hand-drawn, figures. The book provides a feeling for all the key issues and deep current controversies, and counters the common complaint that cutting-edge science is fundamentally inaccessible. <br> <br> <b>TOPICS COVERED:</b> <br>? numbers and geometry in physics <br>? the ideas and magic of calculus <br>? notions of infinity <br>? relativity theory <br>? quantum mechanics <br>? particle physics <br>? cosmology <br>? the big bang <br>? black holes <br>? the second law of thermodynamics <br>? string and M theory <br>? loop quantum gravity <br>? twisters <br>? fashions in science</p><h2>Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships</h2><p>The bestselling &#34;Games People Play&#34; is the book that has helped millions of people understand the dynamics of relationships, by psychiatrist Eric Berne.

Companion to the PBS documentary series. Marvelous. &#x2014;Terry Golway, New York Observer</p><p>This engaging book traces the history, archaeology, and legends of ancient Ireland from 9000 B.C., when nomadic hunter-gatherers appeared in Ireland at the end of the last Ice Age-to 1167 A.D., when an Anglo-Norman invasion brought the country under control of the English crown for the first time. So much of what people today accept as ancient Irish history-Celtic invaders from Europe turning Ireland into a Celtic nation; St. Patrick driving the snakes from Ireland and converting its people to Christianity-is myth and legend with little basis in reality. <p>The truth is more interesting. The Irish, as the authors show, are not even Celtic in an archaeological sense. And there were plenty of bishops in Ireland before a British missionary called Patrick arrived. But In Search of Ancient Ireland is not simply the story of events from long ago. Across Ireland today are ancient sites and folk customs that provide tangible links to events thousands of years past. The authors visit and describe many of these places, talking to a wide variety of historians, archeologists and language scholars, in the very settings where history happened. Thus the book is also a journey on the ground to uncover ten thousand years of Irish identity. It is all here, from the Celtic culture to the rise of the uniquely Irish Christian spirituality to the final chapter which deals with the complex events that lead to the English invasion of the island. </p><p>In Search of Ancient Ireland is the official companion to the PBS series of the same name.</p>Carmel McCaffrey lectures on Irish history, literature, culture, and language at Johns Hopkins University.</p><h2>The Worlds of Joseph Smith: A Bicentennial Conference at the Library of Congress</h2><p>Transcripts from the Library of Congress symposium on Joseph Smith, including speeches by a couple of profesors (Roger Keller, David Paulsen), as well has top-notch LDS and non-LDS scholars like Bushman, Givens, Jan Shipps, Margaret Barker, and Richard Mouw, and also Elder Oaks.

When misery comes to call, the right invention at the right time can mean everything. </p> <p> It's also fortunate that her brother, Klaus, has read lots of books and knows many important things, like how to tell an alligator from a crocodile and who killed Julius Caesar. When everything that can possibly go wrong does, a small fact can be vital. </p> <p> It's lucky, too, that Sunny Baudelaire, the youngest sibling, likes to bite things. Even though she is an infant, and scarcely larger than a boot, she has four very big and sharp teeth. When trouble comes along, sharp teeth can save the day. </p> <p> But most of all, it is good fortune that Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are as sturdy and resilient as they are, for ahead of these three children lies a seemingly infinite series of unfortunate events. </p></p><p>Make no mistake. <i>The Bad Beginning</i> begins badly for the three Baudelaire children, and then gets worse. Their misfortunes begin one gray day on Briny Beach when Mr. Poe tells them that their parents perished in a fire that destroyed their whole house. "It is useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet, Klaus, and even Sunny felt in the time that followed," laments the personable (occasionally pedantic) narrator, who tells the story as if his readers are gathered around an armchair on pillows. But of course what follows is dreadful. The children thought it was bad when the well-meaning Poes bought them grotesque-colored clothing that itched. But when they are ushered to the dilapidated doorstep of the miserable, thin, unshaven, shiny-eyed, money-grubbing Count Olaf, they know that they--and their family fortune--are in real trouble. Still, they could never have anticipated how much trouble. While it's true that the events that unfold in Lemony Snicket's novels are bleak, and things never turn out as you'd hope, these delightful, funny, linguistically playful books are reminiscent of Roald Dahl (remember <i>James and the Giant Peach</i> and his horrid spinster aunts), Charles Dickens (the orphaned Pip in <i>Great Expectations</i> without the mysterious benefactor), and Edward Gorey (<i>The Gashlycrumb Tinies</i>).

But friends can also gossip and betray, tease and exclude. Children can cause untold suffering, not only for their peers but for parents as well. In this wise and insightful book, psychologist Michael Thompson, Ph.D., and children&#x2019;s book author Catherine O&#x2019;Neill Grace, illuminate the crucial and often hidden role that friendship plays in the lives of children from birth through adolescence.<br><br>Drawing on fascinating new research as well as their own extensive experience in schools, Thompson and Grace demonstrate that children&#x2019;s friendships begin early&#x2013;in infancy&#x2013;and run exceptionally deep in intensity and loyalty. As children grow, their friendships become more complex and layered but also more emotionally fraught, marked by both extraordinary intimacy and bewildering cruelty. As parents, we watch, and often live through vicariously, the tumult that our children experience as they encounter the &#x201c;cool&#x201d; crowd, shifting alliances, bullies, and disloyal best friends.<br><br><i>Best Friends, Worst Enemies</i> brings to life the drama of childhood relationships, guiding parents to a deeper understanding of the motives and meanings of social behavior. Here you will find penetrating discussions of the difference between friendship and popularity, how boys and girls deal in unique ways with intimacy and commitment, whether all kids need a best friend, why cliques form and what you can do about them.<br><br>Filled with anecdotes that ring amazingly true to life, <i>Best Friends, Worst Enemies</i> probes the magic and the heartbreak that all children experience with their friends. Parents, teachers, counselors&#x2013;indeed anyone who cares about children&#x2013;will find this an eye-opening and wonderfully affirming book.</p><p>"The stories in this book come from many perspectives &#x2014; those of therapists, educators, and parents.

Tour.</p><p>Familiar territory for the author of The Innkeeper's Song (1993), etc. In Woodmont, Los Angeles, young Josephina ``Joey'' Rivera spends much of her spare time helping out in old John Papas's dusty music shop. One day, in steps a striking young man, Indigo, with an unusual horn he hopes to sell for gold--more gold, indeed, than Papas can readily lay his hands on. On the horn Indigo plays a strange, haunting music that, even when he leaves, Joey can still hear; following the music, she unwittingly steps into another world, Shei'rah, where the Eldest--unicorns--live. Joey is befriended by Ko, a shaggy, lovable satyr, and by eager young unicorn Touriq; sadly, she learns from Lord Sinti that all the Eldest are going blind, for reasons none can fathom. Returning home, Joey finds that Indigo (another Eldest) prefers to live on Earth in human form; selling his horn will enable him to live comfortably, though without it he cannot return to Shei'rah. On her next visit to Shei'rah, Joey brings along her beloved, wise grandmother, Abuelita, who remembers an old folk remedy for blindness whose chief ingredient is--gold! So Indigo must relinquish his gains in order to save the Eldest, whose blindness he caused in the first place with his greed for gold. This slight, insubstantial fable has lyrical intentions, but ends up just self-consciously picturesque; though the strained, flimsy plotting and blurry details don't help, Beagle's deserved renown as a leading unicornologist might carry readers along.

All rights reserved.</i>A strangely beautiful boy named Indigo comes into Papas Music one afternoon. He plays some ethereal music on a strange horn that he says he'll sell for gold. But when supposedly poor John Papas proffers a stash of gold coins, he hesitates and then seems to vanish. Thirteen-year-old Joey Rivera, who helps Papas in exchange for theory lessons, can't forget the music: she hears it beckoning beneath everyday traffic. Following it one day, she crosses a shimmering border into Shei'rah, an idyllic land of benign satyrs, tiny dragons, water sprites, and, over all these and other fantastic creatures, the Eldest, a race of unicorns. The music emanates from the place and especially from the Eldest, whose only woe is a mysterious blindness that of late has beset them early in their millennia-long lives. Returning to her world after what seems a long time, Joey finds only minutes have elapsed on Earth. She goes back to Shei'rah several times, learns that Indigo is actually a unicorn who wants to become human because then he'll be able to make life choices, and finally brings her <i>abuelita</i> along to help cure the blindness (Indigo, however, holds the trump card for the cure). In this slight fairy romance, America's finest gentle fantasist manages to point up the best qualities of both real life and fantasy, of both Earth and Shei'rah. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>You Should Have Left: A Novel</h2><p><b>From the internationally best-selling author of <i>Measuring the World</i> and<i> F,</i> an eerie and supernatural tale of a writer's emotional collapse</b><br><br><i>"It is fitting that I'm beginning a new notebook up here.

I was trembling, I had difficulty breathing, my eyes were watering, my legs went weak&#x2014;this didn&#x2019;t actually happen to my real body, of course, so is it possible that I wasn&#x2019;t afraid at all, that it was only my dream self, just as only my dream hands were trembling? No, the fear was as real as fear can be, and burned in me, and when it was no longer tolerable, the woman took a step back, as if she were releasing me, and only then was I back in our bedroom, where I heard Susanna&#x2019;s steady breathing and saw the moonlight falling softly through the window, and the baby monitor showed our daughter in a deep sleep.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Breakfast: Bright grass and even brighter sun, no clouds, the air full of birds whose names I don&#x2019;t know; I&#x2019;ve always regretted that I can&#x2019;t identify birds by name.

Covering everything from snail sex to the manufacture of synthetic slug slime, Gordon takes us on a journey through the languid and magical world of these charismatic invertebrates. From essays like Grow Your Own Escargot to indispensable gardening tips, this book is chock-full of information on the much-maligned mollusks. Whether removing non-native slugs from your garden or following a native snail as it meanders across the forest floor, you&#39;ll never look at these underdogs the same way again. David George Gordon is the author of nineteen books about the natural world, including the best-selling Eat-a-Bug Cookbook and The Compleat Cockroach. Karen Luke Fildes is an accomplished artist who has studied at both the Art Institute of Seattle and Chapman University. Both live in Seattle.</p><p>The author of 16 books on wildlife and wild places, David George Gordon playfully and thoughtfully sheds light on a fascinating animal kingdom. Karen Luke Fildes is an accomplished artist who has studied at both the Art Institute of Seattle and Chapman U"Unlikely as gastropods may seem as a topic for a book-length study, naturalist Gordon ably enlivens them, combining facts with quotations, a colloquial style, and curious historical references, from Pliny the Elder and Roman snail farmers to 18th-century pharmacists. Fildes&#x2019;s line drawings recall woodcuts and add a touch of whimsy, aiding the impression that soft-bodied creatures should be regarded as more than agricultural nuisances or 'cogs in nature&#x2019;s Grande Machine.' In four chapters--divided with clever, occasionally tongue-in-cheek subheadings as well as informational boxes--Gordon offers a solid overview of these gastropods, beginning with their place in the animal kingdom; continuing with discussions that reveal medicinal and culinary uses; listing some of the common varieties; exploring their physiology (including the properties of their slime); and finally, providing environmental suggestions for balancing their populations in the average yard. A highly approachable read for the neophyte science aficionado and the gardening enthusiast and an entertaining take on the timeless adage, 'the meek shall inherit the earth.'"<br><i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i><br><br>"From the get-go, 'The Secret World of Slugs and Snails' is a charmer, and one you won't have to slog through.

There's even a recipe for growing your own escargot, which shouldn't be suprising given Gordon's fame for cooking with insects.

Reprint.</p><p>Dubbed by the Sunday Times as, &#39;Simply the best detective writer since Agatha Christie&#39; and by the Yorkshire Post as &#39;the most underrated British crime writer&#39;, Caroline Graham is the author of eight Inspector Barnaby novels.A game of murder in an English country house appears headed for the real thing in this lumbering attempt at a romp. Simon Hannaford and his sister Laurie are left in charge of their aunt's estate near Oxford while she travels abroad; to settle some debts, Simon decides to sponsor a murder-mystery weekend for well-paying guests. Those who sign on include mystery aficionado Derek Gregory; his wife, Sheila; and snooty Mrs. Laetitia Saville with her daughter Rosemary, who are appalled by the wealthy but common gypsy family Gibbs--Fred, Vi and Mother Gibbs. It soon appears that everyone at Madingley Grange has arrived with ulterior motives, including the temp-service staff who are casing the place with an eye to burglary. When Derek is chosen victim, much to his voluble distaste, and then is found actually murdered the next day, Simon and Laurie's problems really begin. While Graham ( Death of a Hollow Man ) does give us the outline of a classic country house mystery, this is not Wodehouse-meets-Christie material, lacking the essential wit and complexity of both masters.

Although Spangler possesses numerous gifts as a writer and spiritual leader (he is a former coleader of Scotland's spiritual community Findhorn), his most meaningful life work has always taken place within the boundaries of marriage and parenthood (he is the father of four children). So it was only fitting that this self-described "freelance mystic" finally shed his wisdom and humor upon this sacred and mundane act. "We may think of mysticism as the dimension of complex issues of theology and spiritual cosmology, but it is really much simpler," explains Spangler. "It is, at heart, about learning how to recognize and work with the connectedness of the world, the wholeness of all things. Love is at its root, and love is equally at the root of what we do as parents. It is in the spirit of this common rootedness that the parent embodies the mystic and mystic the parent."<p> In sharing his parenting challenges (such as staying present in the presence of a flailing, crying baby or trying to honor a daughter's yearning to become a racehorse jockey), Spangler has packaged a book so tender and profound that parents cannot help but be inspired to bring their highest and most joyful selves to every interaction of parenthood. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>The words "parent" and "mystic" may seem an odd combination, but most parents will tell you that the birth of a child is spiritually significant -- in some way a mystical experience, a connection with the divine. There is a feeling of magic in the parent-child relationship that relies on intuition, total presence, and impulses that come from neither the mind nor the body -- impulses of the soul.<p>Full of down-and-dirty stories from life with his own four children, and charged with David Spangler's sharp wit and warm sensibility, Parent as Mystic, Mystic as Parent is a book about the ordinary -- the blessings of the day in and day out of child rearing. It's a captivating and inspiring guide for mothers and fathers in the trenches, trying to build strong, spiritually fulfilling families that work. A book that encourages us, with grace and humor, toward the kind of conscious parenting that brings the world creative, honest, independent kids.</p></p><h2>The Souls of Black Folk (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics Series)</h2><p>&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Souls of Black Folk&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R, by &amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RW.

E. B. Du Bois&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&#x2019;s &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Souls of Black Folk&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R is an eloquent collection of fourteen essays that describe the life, the ambitions, the struggles, and the passions of African Americans at the transition from the nineteenth to the twentieth century. &amp;&amp;LP&amp;&amp;RThe first African American to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard University, Du Bois was a sociologist, historian, novelist, and activist whose astounding career spanned the nation&#x2019;s history from Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Movement. In &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Souls of Black Folk&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R, published in 1903, Du Bois argued against the conciliatory position taken by Booker T. Washington, at the time the most influential black leader in America, and called for a more radical form of aggressive protest&#x2015;a strategy that would anticipate and inspire much of the activism of the 1960s. &amp;&amp;LP&amp;&amp;RDu Bois&#x2019;s essays were the first to articulate many of Black America&#x2019;s thoughts and feelings, including the dilemma posed by the black psyche&#x2019;s &#x201c;double consciousness,&#x201d; which Du Bois described as &#x201c;this twoness&#x2015;an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings . . . in one dark body.&#x201d; Every essay in The Souls of Black Folk is a jewel of intellectual prowess, eloquent language, and groundbreaking insight. It is essential reading for anyone interested in the struggle for Civil Rights in America.&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LB&amp;&amp;RFarah Jasmine Griffin&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R is Professor of English and Comparative Literature and African-American Studies at Columbia University in New York City. &amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/DIV&amp;&amp;R</p><p>William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868-1963) is the greatest of African American intellectuals--a sociologist, historian, novelist, and activist whose astounding career spanned the nation's history from Reconstruction to the civil rights movement. Born in Massachusetts and educated at Fisk, Harvard, and the University of Berlin, Du Bois penned his epochal masterpiece, <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i>, in 1903. It remains his most studied and popular work; its insights into Negro life at the turn of the 20th century still ring true.<p> With a dash of the Victorian and Enlightenment influences that peppered his impassioned yet formal prose, the book's largely autobiographical chapters take the reader through the momentous and moody maze of Afro-American life after the Emancipation Proclamation: from poverty, the neoslavery of the sharecropper, illiteracy, miseducation, and lynching, to the heights of humanity reached by the spiritual "sorrow songs" that birthed gospel and the blues. The most memorable passages are contained in "On Booker T. Washington and Others," where Du Bois criticizes his famous contemporary's rejection of higher education and accommodationist stance toward white racism: "Mr. Washington's programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races," he writes, further complaining that Washington's thinking "withdraws many of the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens." The capstone of <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i>, though, is Du Bois' haunting, eloquent description of the concept of the black psyche's "double consciousness," which he described as "a peculiar sensation.... One ever feels this twoness--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder." Thanks to W.E.B. Du Bois' commitment and foresight--and the intellectual excellence expressed in this timeless literary gem--black Americans can today look in the mirror and rejoice in their beautiful black, brown, and beige reflections. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line." Thus speaks W.E.B. Du Bois in <i>The Souls Of Black Folk</i>, one of the most prophetic and influental works in American literature. In this eloquent collection of essays, first published in 1903, Du Bois dares as no one has before to describe the magnitude of American racism and demand an end to it. He draws on his own life for illustration, from his early experiences teaching in the hills of Tennessee to the death of his infant son and his historic break with the conciliatory position of Booker T. Washington.<p></p><p>Far ahead of its time, <i>The Souls Of Black Folk</i> both anticipated and inspired much of the black conciousness and activism of the 1960's and is a classic in the literature of civil rights. The elegance of DuBois's prose and the passion of his message are as crucial today as they were upon the book's first publication.</p></p><h2>What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars</h2><p>DJ missing.

Today, it is the most common form of officially classified mental illness. Scott Stossel gracefully guides us across the terrain of an affliction that is pervasive yet too often misunderstood.<br><br> Drawing on his own long-standing battle with anxiety, Stossel presents an astonishing history, at once intimate and authoritative, of the efforts to understand the condition from medical, cultural, philosophical, and experiential perspectives. He ranges from the earliest medical reports of Galen and Hippocrates, through later observations by Robert Burton and S�ren Kierkegaard, to the investigations by great nineteenth-century scientists, such as Charles Darwin, William James, and Sigmund Freud, as they began to explore its sources and causes, to the latest research by neuroscientists and geneticists. Stossel reports on famous individuals who struggled with anxiety, as well as on the afflicted generations of his own family. His portrait of anxiety reveals not only the emotion&#x2019;s myriad manifestations and the anguish anxiety produces but also the countless psychotherapies, medications, and other (often outlandish) treatments that have been developed to counteract it. Stossel vividly depicts anxiety&#x2019;s human toll&#x2014;its crippling impact, its devastating power to paralyze&#x2014;while at the same time exploring how those who suffer from it find ways to manage and control it. <br> <i>My Age of Anxiety</i> is learned and empathetic, humorous and inspirational, offering the reader great insight into the biological, cultural, and environmental factors that contribute to the affliction.</p><p>Scott Stossel is the editor of <i>The Atlantic</i> and the author of <i>Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver.</i> His articles and essays have appeared in <i>The Atlantic,</i> <i>The New Yorker,</i> <i>The New Republic,</i> <i>The New York Times,</i> <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> and many other publications. He lives with his family in Washington, D.C.Some eighty years ago, Freud proposed that anxiety was "a riddle whose solution would be bound to throw a flood of light on our whole mental existence." Unlocking the mysteries of anxiety, he believed, would go far in helping us to unravel the mysteries of the mind: consciousness, the self, identity, intellect, imagination, creativity &#x2014; not to mention pain, suffering, hope, and regret. To grapple with and understand anxiety is, in some sense, to grapple with and understand the human condition.<br><br> The differences in how various cultures and eras have perceived and understood anxiety can tell us a lot about those cultures and eras. Why did the ancient Greeks of the Hippocratic school see anxiety mainly as a medical condition, while Enlightenment philosophers saw it as an intellectual problem? Why did the early existentialists see anxiety as a spiritual condition, while Gilded Age doctors saw it as a specifically Anglo-Saxon stress response &#x2014; a response that they believed spared Catholic societies &#x2014; to the Industrial Revolution? Why did the early Freudians see anxiety as a psychological condition emanating from sexual inhibition, whereas our own age tends to see it, once again, as a medical and neurochemical condition, a problem of malfunctioning biomechanics?<br><br> Do these shifting interpretations represent the forward march of progress and science? Or simply the changing, and often cyclical, ways in which cultures work? What does it say about the societies in question that Americans showing up in emergency rooms with panic attacks tend to believe they're having heart attacks, whereas Japanese tend to be afraid they're going to faint? Are the Iranians who complain of what they call "heart distress" suffering what Western psychiatrists would call panic attacks? Are the <i>ataques de nervios</i> experienced by South Americans simply panic attacks with a Latino inflection &#x2014; or are they, as modern researchers now believe, a distinct cultural and medical syndrome? Why do drug treatments for anxiety that work so well on Americans and the French seem not to work effectively on the Chinese?<br><br> As fascinating and multifarious as these cultural idiosyncrasies are, the underlying consistency of experience across time and cultures speaks to the universality of anxiety as a human trait. Even filtered through the distinctive cultural practices and beliefs of the Greenland Inuit a hundred years ago, the syndrome the Inuit called "kayak angst" (those afflicted by it were afraid to go out seal hunting alone) appears to be little different from what we today call agoraphobia. In Hippocrates's ancient writings can be found clinical descriptions of pathological anxiety that sound quite modern. One of his patients was terrified of cats (simple phobia, which today would be coded 300.29 for insurance purposes, according to the classifications of the fifth edition of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</i>, the <i>DSM-V</i>) and another of nightfall; a third, Hippocrates reported, was "beset by terror" whenever he heard a flute; a fourth could not walk alongside "even the shallowest ditch," though he had no problem walking <i>inside</i> the ditch &#x2014; evidence of what we would today call acrophobia, the fear of heights. Hippocrates also describes a patient suffering what would likely be called, in modern diagnostic terminology, panic disorder with agoraphobia (<i>DSM-V</i> code 300.22): the condition, as Hippocrates described it, "usually attacks abroad, if a person is travelling a lonely road somewhere, and fear seizes him." The syndromes described by Hippocrates are recognizably the same clinical phenomena described in the latest issues of the <i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i> and <i>Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic</i>.<br><br> Their similarities bridge the yawning gap of millennia and circumstances that separate them, providing a sense of how, for all the differences in culture and setting, the physiologically anxious aspects of human experience may be universal.<br><br> In this book, I have set out to explore the "riddle" of anxiety. I am not a doctor, a psychologist, a sociologist, or a historian of science &#x2014; any one of whom would bring more scholarly authority to a treatise on anxiety than I do. This is a work of synthesis and reportage, yoking together explorations of the idea of anxiety from history, literature, philosophy, religion, popular culture, and the latest scientific research &#x2014; all of that woven through something about which I can, alas, claim extensive expertise: my own experience with anxiety. Examining the depths of my own neuroses may seem the height of narcissism (and studies do show that self-preoccupation tends to be tied to anxiety), but it's an exercise with worthy antecedents. In 1621, the Oxford scholar Robert Burton published his canonical <i>The Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, a staggering thirteen-hundred-page work of synthesis, whose torrents of scholarly exegesis only partially obscure what it really is: a massive litany of anxious, depressive complaint. In 1733, George Cheyne, a prominent London physician and one of the most influential psychological thinkers of the eighteenth century, published <i>The English Malady</i>, which includes the forty-page chapter "The Case of the Author" (dedicated to "my fellow sufferers"), in which he reports in minute detail on his neuroses (including "Fright, Anxiety, Dread, and Terror" and "a melancholy Fright and Panick, where my Reason was of no Use to me") and physical symptoms (including "a sudden violent Head-ach," "extream Sickness in my Stomach," and "a constant Colick, and an ill Taste and Savour in my Mouth") over the years. More recently, the intellectual odysseys of Charles Darwin, Sigmund Freud, and William James were powerfully driven by their curiosity about, and the desire to find relief from, their own anxious suffering. Freud used his acute train phobia and his hypochondria, among other things, to construct his theory of psychoanalysis; Darwin was effectively housebound by stress-related illnesses after the voyage of the <i>Beagle</i> &#x2014; he spent years in pursuit of relief from his anxiety, visiting spas and, on the advice of one doctor, encasing himself in ice. James tried to keep his phobias hidden from the public but was often quietly terrified. "I awoke morning after morning with a horrible dread in the pit of my stomach and with a sense of insecurity of life that I never knew before," he wrote in 1902 of the onset of his anxiety. "For months, I was unable to go out in the dark alone."<br> <br>Unlike Darwin, Freud, and James, I'm not out to adumbrate a whole new theory of mind or of human nature. Rather, this book is motivated by a quest to understand, and to find relief from or redemption in, anxious suffering. This quest has taken me both backward, into history, and forward, to the frontiers of modern scientific research. I have spent much of the past eight years reading through hundreds of thousands of the pages that have been written about anxiety over the last three thousand years.<br><br> My life has, thankfully, lacked great tragedy or melodrama. I haven't served any jail time. I haven't been to rehab. I haven't assaulted anyone or carried out a suicide attempt. I haven't woken up naked in the middle of a field, sojourned in a crack house, or been fired from a job for erratic behavior. As psychopathologies go, mine has been &#x2014; so far, most of the time, to outward appearances &#x2014; quiet. Robert Downey Jr. will not be starring in the movie of my life. I am, as they say in the clinical literature, "high functioning" for someone with an anxiety disorder or a mental illness; I'm usually quite good at hiding it. More than a few people, some of whom think they know me quite well, have remarked that they are struck that I, who can seem so even-keeled and imperturbable, would choose to write a book about anxiety. I smile gently while churning inside and thinking about what I've learned is a signature characteristic of the phobic personality: "the need and ability" &#x2014; as described in the self-help book <i>Your Phobia</i> &#x2014; "to present a relatively placid, untroubled appearance to others, while suffering extreme distress on the inside." *<br> <br>To some people, I may seem calm. But if you could peer beneath the surface, you would see that I'm like a duck &#x2014; paddling, paddling, paddling.<br><br> *<i> "For many, many people who have anxiety disorders &#x2014; particularly agoraphobia and panic disorder &#x2014; people would be surprised to find out that they have problems with anxiety because they seem so'together' and in control," says Paul Foxman, a psychologist who heads the Center for Anxiety Disorders in Burlington, Vermont. "They seem to be comfortable, but there's a disconnection between the public self and the private self."</i></p><h2>Henry Reed&#39;s Baby-Sitting Service</h2><p>While spending the summer with his aunt and uncle in Grover&#39;s Corner, Henry decides to set up a baby-sitting service</p><p></p><h2>No-No Boy</h2><p><b>The first Japanese American novel: a powerful, radical testament to the experiences of Japanese American draft resisters in the wake of World War II</b><br><br><b>A Penguin Classic</b><br><br>After their forcible relocation to internment camps during World War II, Japanese Americans were expected to go on with their lives as though nothing had happened, assimilating as well as they could in a changed America. But some men resisted. They became known as "no-no boys," for twice having answered no on a compulsory government survey asking whether they were willing to serve in the U.S. armed forces and to swear allegiance to the United States.<i> No-No Boy</i> tells the story of one such draft resister, Ichiro Yamada, whose refusal to comply with the U.S. government earns him two years in prison and the disapproval of his family and community in Seattle. A touchstone of the immigrant experience in America, it dispels the "model minority" myth and asks pointed questions about assimilation, identity, and loyalty.<br><br><b>Celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month with these four Penguin Classics:</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>America Is in the Heart </i>by Carlos Bulosan (9780143134039)<br> <i>East Goes West </i>by Younghill Kang (9780143134305)<br> <i>The Hanging on Union Square </i>by H.

She is a professor of literature and creative writing at the University of California, Santa Cruz.<p>1</p><p>Two weeks after his twenty-fifth birthday, Ichiro got off a bus at Second and Main in Seattle. He had been gone four years, two in camp and two in prison.</p><p>Walking down the street that autumn morning with a small, black suitcase, he felt like an intruder in a world to which he had no claim. It was just enough that he should feel this way, for, of his own free will, he had stood before the judge and said that he would not go in the army. At the time there was no other choice for him. That was when he was twenty-three, a man of twenty-three. Now, two years older, he was even more of a man.</p><p>Christ, he thought to himself, just a goddamn kid is all I was. Didn't know enough to wipe my own nose. What the hell have I done? What am I doing back here? Best thing I can do would be to kill some son of a bitch and head back to prison.</p><p>He walked toward the railroad depot where the tower with the clocks on all four sides was. It was a dirty-looking tower of ancient brick. It was a dirty city. Dirtier, certainly, than it had a right to be after only four years.</p><p>Waiting for the light to change to green, he looked around at the people standing at the bus stop. A couple of men in suits, half a dozen women who failed to arouse him even after prolonged good behavior, and a young Japanese with a lunch bucket. Ichiro studied him, searching in his mind for the name that went with the round, pimply face and the short-cropped hair. The pimples were gone and the face had hardened, but the hair was still cropped. The fellow wore green, army-fatigue trousers and an Eisenhower jacket-Eto Minato. The name came to him at the same time as did the horrible significance of the army clothes. In panic, he started to step off the curb. It was too late. He had been seen.</p><p>"Itchy!" That was his nickname.</p><p>Trying to escape, Ichiro urged his legs frenziedly across the street.</p><p>"Hey, Itchy!" The caller's footsteps ran toward him.</p><p>An arm was placed across his back. Ichiro stopped and faced the other Japanese. He tried to smile, but could not. There was no way out now.</p><p>"I'm Eto. Remember?" Eto smiled and extended his palm. Reluctantly, Ichiro lifted his own hand and let the other shake it.</p><p>The round face with the round eyes peered at him through silver-rimmed spectacles. "What the hell! It's been a long time, but not that long. How've you been? What's doing?"</p><p>"Well . . . that is, I'm . . ."</p><p>"Last time must have been before Pearl Harbor. God, it's been quite a while, hasn't it? Three, no, closer to four years, I guess. Lotsa Japs coming back to the Coast. Lotsa Japs in Seattle. You'll see 'em around. Japs are funny that way. Gotta have their rice and sak�&nbsp;and other Japs. Stupid, I say. The smart ones went to Chicago and New York and lotsa places back east, but there's still plenty coming back out this way." Eto drew cigarettes from his breast pocket and held out the package. "No? Well, I'll have one. Got the habit in the army. Just got out a short while back. Rough time, but I made it. Didn't get out in time to make the quarter, but I'm planning to go to school. How long you been around?"</p><p>Ichiro touched his toe to the suitcase. "Just got in. Haven't been home yet."</p><p>"When'd you get discharged?"</p><p>A car grinding its gears started down the street. He wished he were in it. "I . . . that is . . . I never was in."</p><p>Eto slapped him good-naturedly on the arm. "No need to look so sour. So you weren't in. So what? Been in camp all this time?"</p><p>"No." He made an effort to be free of Eto with his questions. He felt as if he were in a small room whose walls were slowly closing in on him. "It's been a long time, I know, but I'm really anxious to see the folks."</p><p>"What the hell. Let's have a drink. On me. I don't give a damn if I'm late to work. As for your folks, you'll see them soon enough. You drink, don't you?"</p><p>"Yeah, but not now."</p><p>"Ahh." Eto was disappointed. He shifted his lunch box from under one arm to the other.</p><p>"I've really got to be going."</p><p>The round face wasn't smiling any more. It was thoughtful. The eyes confronted Ichiro with indecision which changed slowly to enlightenment and then to suspicion. He remembered. He knew.</p><p>The friendliness was gone as he said: "No-no boy, huh?"</p><p>Ichiro wanted to say yes. He wanted to return the look of despising hatred and say simply yes, but it was too much to say. The walls had closed in and were crushing all the unspoken words back down into his stomach. He shook his head once, not wanting to evade the eyes but finding it impossible to meet them. Out of his big weakness the little ones were branching, and the eyes he didn't have the courage to face were ever present. If it would have helped to gouge out his own eyes, he would have done so long ago. The hate-churned eyes with the stamp of unrelenting condemnation were his cross and he had driven the nails with his own hands.</p><p>"Rotten bastard. Shit on you." Eto coughed up a mouthful of sputum and rolled his words around it: "Rotten, no-good bastard."</p><p>Surprisingly, Ichiro felt relieved. Eto's anger seemed to serve as a release to his own naked tensions. As he stooped to lift the suitcase a wet wad splattered over his hand and dripped onto the black leather. The legs of his accuser were in front of him. God in a pair of green fatigues, U.S. Army style. They were the legs of the jury that had passed sentence upon him. Beseech me, they seemed to say, throw your arms about me and bury your head between my knees and seek pardon for your great sin.</p><p>"I'll piss on you next time," said Eto vehemently.</p><p>He turned as he lifted the suitcase off the ground and hurried away from the legs and the eyes from which no escape was possible.</p><p>Jackson Street started at the waterfront and stretched past the two train depots and up the hill all the way to the lake, where the houses were bigger and cleaner and had garages with late-model cars in them. For Ichiro, Jackson Street signified that section of the city immediately beyond the railroad tracks between Fifth and Twelfth Avenues. That was the section which used to be pretty much Japanese town. It was adjacent to Chinatown and most of the gambling and prostitution and drinking seemed to favor the area.</p><p>Like the dirty clock tower of the depot, the filth of Jackson Street had increased. Ichiro paused momentarily at an alley and peered down the passage formed by the walls of two sagging buildings. There had been a door there at one time, a back door to a movie house which only charged a nickel. A nickel was a lot of money when he had been seven or nine or eleven. He wanted to go into the alley to see if the door was still there.</p><p>Being on Jackson Street with its familiar store fronts and taverns and restaurants, which were somehow different because the war had left its mark on them, was like trying to find one's way out of a dream that seemed real most of the time but wasn't really real because it was still only a dream. The war had wrought violent changes upon the people, and the people, in turn, working hard and living hard and earning a lot of money and spending it on whatever was available, had distorted the profile of Jackson Street. The street had about it the air of a carnival without quite succeeding at becoming one. A shooting gallery stood where once had been a clothing store; fish and chips had replaced a jewelry shop; and a bunch of Negroes were horsing around raucously in front of a pool parlor. Everything looked older and dirtier and shabbier.</p><p>He walked past the pool parlor, picking his way gingerly among the Negroes, of whom there had been only a few at one time and of whom there seemed to be nothing but now. They were smoking and shouting and cussing and carousing and the sidewalk was slimy with their spittle.</p><p>"Jap!"</p><p>His pace quickened automatically, but curiosity or fear or indignation or whatever it was made him glance back at the white teeth framed in a leering dark brown which was almost black.</p><p>"Go back to Tokyo, boy." Persecution in the drawl of the persecuted.</p><p>The white teeth and brown-black leers picked up the cue and jigged to the rhythmical chanting of "Jap-boy, To-ki-yo; Jap-boy, To-ki-yo . . ."</p><p>Friggin' niggers, he uttered savagely to himself and, from the same place deep down inside where tolerance for the Negroes and the Jews and the Mexicans and the Chinese and the too short and too fat and too ugly abided because he was Japanese and knew what it was like better than did those who were white and average and middle class and good Democrats or liberal Republicans, the hate which was unrelenting and terrifying seethed up.</p><p>Then he was home. It was a hole in the wall with groceries crammed in orderly confusion on not enough shelving, into not enough space. He knew what it would be like even before he stepped in. His father had described the place to him in a letter, composed in simple Japanese characters because otherwise Ichiro could not have read it. The letter had been purposely repetitive and painstakingly detailed so that Ichiro should not have any difficulty finding the place. The grocery store was the same one the Ozakis had operated for many years. That's all his father had had to say. Come to the grocery store which was once the store of the Ozakis. The Japanese characters, written simply so that he could read them, covered pages of directions as if he were a foreigner coming to the city for the first time.</p><p>Thinking about the letter made him so mad that he forgot about the Negroes. He opened the door just as he had a thousand times when they had lived farther down the block and he used to go to the Ozakis' for a loaf of bread or a jar of pickled scallions, and the bell tinkled just as he knew it would. All the grocery stores he ever knew had bells which tinkled when one opened the door and the familiar sound softened his inner turmoil.</p><p>"Ichiro?" The short, round man who came through the curtains at the back of the store uttered the name preciously as might an old woman. "Ya, Ichiro, you have come home. How good that you have come home!" The gently spoken Japanese which he had not heard for so long sounded strange. He would hear a great deal of it now that he was home, for his parents, like most of the old Japanese, spoke virtually no English. On the other hand, the children, like Ichiro, spoke almost no Japanese. Thus they communicated, the old speaking Japanese with an occasional badly mispronounced word or two of English; and the young, with the exception of a simple word or phrase of Japanese which came fairly effortlessly to the lips, resorting almost constantly to the tongue the parents avoided.</p><p>The father bounced silently over the wood flooring in slippered feet toward his son. Fondly, delicately, he placed a pudgy hand on Ichiro's elbow and looked up at his son who was Japanese but who had been big enough for football and tall enough for basketball in high school. He pushed the elbow and Ichiro led the way into the back, where there was a kitchen, a bathroom, and one bedroom. He looked around the bedroom and felt like puking. It was neat and clean and scrubbed. His mother would have seen to that. It was just the idea of everybody sleeping in the one room. He wondered if his folks still pounded flesh.</p><p>He backed out of the bedroom and slumped down on a stool. "Where's Ma?"</p><p>"Mama is gone to the bakery." The father kept his beaming eyes on his son who was big and tall. He shut off the flow of water and shifted the metal teapot to the stove.</p><p>"What for?"</p><p>"Bread," his father said in reply, "bread for the store."</p><p>"Don't they deliver?"</p><p>"Ya, they deliver." He ran a damp rag over the table, which was spotlessly clean.</p><p>"What the hell is she doing at the bakery then?"</p><p>"It is good business, Ichiro." He was at the cupboard, fussing with the teacups and saucers and cookies. "The truck comes in the morning. We take enough for the morning business. For the afternoon, we get soft, fresh bread. Mama goes to the bakery."</p><p>Ichiro tried to think of a bakery nearby and couldn't. There was a big Wonder Bread bakery way up on Nineteenth, where a nickel used to buy a bagful of day-old stuff. That was thirteen and a half blocks, all uphill. He knew the distance by heart because he'd walked it twice every day to go to grade school, which was a half-block beyond the bakery or fourteen blocks from home.</p><p>"What bakery?"</p><p>The water on the stove began to boil and the old man flipped the lid on the pot and tossed in a pinch of leaves. "Wonder Bread."</p><p>"Is that the one up on Nineteenth?"</p><p>"Ya."</p><p>"How much do you make on bread?"</p><p>"Let's see," he said pouring the tea. "Oh, three, four cents. Depends."</p><p>"How many loaves does Ma get?"</p><p>"Ten or twelve. Depends."</p><p>Ten loaves at three or four cents' profit added up to thirty or forty cents. He compromised at thirty-five cents and asked the next question: "The bus, how much is it?"</p><p>"Oh, let's see." He sipped the tea noisily, sucking it through his teeth in well-regulated gulps. "Let's see. Fifteen cents for one time. Tokens are two for twenty-five cents. That is twelve and one-half cents."</p><p>Twenty-five cents for bus fare to get ten loaves of bread which turned a profit of thirty-five cents. It would take easily an hour to make the trip up and back. He didn't mean to shout, but he shouted: "Christ, Pa, what else do you give away?"</p><p>His father peered over the teacup with a look of innocent surprise.</p><p>It made him madder. "Figure it out. Just figure it out. Say you make thirty-five cents on ten loaves. You take a bus up and back and there's twenty-five cents shot. That leaves ten cents. On top of that, there's an hour wasted. What are you running a business for? Your health?"</p><br>sak</p><h2>The War That Ended Peace: The Road To 1914</h2><p>&nbsp;The First World War followed a period of sustained peace in Europe during which people talked with confidence of prosperity, progress, and hope. But in 1914, Europe walked into a catastrophic conflict that killed millions, bled its economies dry, shook empires and societies to pieces, and fatally undermined Europe&#x2019;s dominance of the world. It was a war that could have been avoided up to the last moment&#x2014;so why did it happen? Beginning in the early nineteenth century and ending with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, award-winning historian Margaret MacMillan uncovers the huge political and technological changes, national decisions, and just as important, the small moments of human muddle and weakness that led Europe from peace to disaster. This masterful exploration of how Europe chose its path toward war will change and enrich how we see this defining moment in our history. <p> </p></p><p><b> MARGARET MacMILLAN </b> is the renowned author of <i>Women of the Raj, </i>Stephen Leacock (Extraordinary Canadians series), and the international bestsellers <i>Nixon in China </i>and <i>Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World, </i>which won the 2003 Governor General&#x2019;s Award and the 2002 Samuel Johnson Prize.

There was little kindness to be found in the press comments at the time. The exhibitions were not ready; the site was a dusty mess of building works; and almost everyone hated the giant statue over the entrance of a woman modeled on the actress Sarah Bernhardt and dressed in a fashionable evening dress. Yet the Exposition went on to be a triumph, with over 50 million visitors.<br><br>In style and content the Exposition partly celebrated the glories of the past and each nation displayed its national treasures&#x2014;whether paintings, sculptures, rare books or scrolls&#x2014;and its national activities. So where the Canadian pavilion had piles of furs, the Finnish showed lots of wood, and the Portuguese decorated their pavilion with ornamental fish. Many of the European pavilions mimicked great Gothic or Renaissance buildings, although little Switzerland built a chalet. The Chinese copied a part of the Forbidden City in Beijing and Siam (today Thailand) put up a pagoda. The Ottoman Empire, that dwindling but still great state which stretched from the Balkans in southern Europe through Turkey to the Arab Middle East, chose a pavilion which was a jumble of styles, much like its own peoples who included Christians, Muslims and Jews and many different ethnicities. With colored tiles and bricks, arches, towers, Gothic windows, elements of mosques, of the Grand Bazaar from Constantinople (now Istanbul), it was fitting that the overall result still somehow resembled the Hagia Sophia, once a great Christian church that became a mosque after the Ottoman conquest.<br><br>Germany&#x2019;s pavilion was surmounted by a statue of a herald blowing a trumpet, suitable, perhaps, for the newest of the great European powers. Inside was an exact reproduction of Frederick the Great&#x2019;s library; tactfully the Germans did not focus on his military victories, many of them over France. The western facade hinted, though, at a new rivalry, the one which was developing between Germany and the world&#x2019;s greatest naval power, Great Britain: a panel showed a stormy sea with sirens calling and had a motto rumored to be written by Germany&#x2019;s ruler, Kaiser Wilhelm II, himself: &#x201c;Fortune&#x2019;s star invites the courageous man to pull up the anchor and throw himself into the conquest of the waves.&#x201d; Elsewhere at the Exposition were reminders of the rapidly burgeoning power of a country that had only come into existence in 1871; the Palace of Electricity contained a giant crane from Germany which could lift 25,000 kilos.<br><br>Austria-Hungary, Germany&#x2019;s closest friend in Europe, had two separate pavilions, one for each half of what had come to be known as the Dual Monarchy. The Austrian one was a triumph of Art Nouveau, the new style which had been catching on in Europe. Marble cherubs and dolphins played around its fountains, giant statues held up its staircases and every inch of its walls appeared to be covered by gold leaf, precious stones, happy or sad masks, or garlands. A grand reception room was set aside for members of the Habsburg family which had presided for centuries over the great empire stretching from the center of Europe down to the Alps and Adriatic, and the exhibits showed off the work of Poles, Czechs, and South Slavs from the Dalmatian coast, only some of the Dual Monarchy&#x2019;s many peoples. Next to the Austrian pavilion and separating it from that of Hungary stood a smaller one, representing the little province of Bosnia, still technically part of the Ottoman Empire but administered since 1878 from Vienna. The Bosnian pavilion, with its lovely decorations by craftsmen from its capital of Sarajevo, looked, said the guide published by Hachette, like a young girl being brought out into the world for the first time by her parents.1 (And they were not particularly happy ones at that.)<br><br>The mood of the Hungarian pavilion was strongly nationalistic. (Austrian critics said sourly that the folk art on display was vulgar and its colors too bright.) The exhibits also included a reconstruction of the great citadel of Comorn (Kom�ron) in the north which stood in the way of the Ottomans in the sixteenth century as they stretched northwards into Europe. Much more recently, in 1848, it had been held by Hungarian nationalists in the revolt against the Habsburgs but had fallen to Austrian forces in 1849. Another room was dedicated to the Hussars, famous for their bravery in the wars against the Ottomans. The exhibits paid less attention though to the millions of non-Hungarian peoples, Croatians or Rumanians, for example, who lived within Hungary&#x2019;s borders.<br><br>Italy, like Germany a new country and a great power more by courtesy than in reality, had built what looked like a vast, richly decorated cathedral. On its golden dome stood a giant eagle, its wings outstretched in triumph. Inside it was filled with art from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but the glories of the past could weigh heavily on a poor young country. Britain, by contrast, chose to be low key even though it still dominated much of the world&#x2019;s trade and manufacturing and had the world&#x2019;s biggest navy and largest empire. Its exhibit was housed in a cozy country house designed by rising young architect Edwin Lutyens in the half-timbered Tudor style and consisted mainly of English paintings from the eighteenth century. Some private British owners had refused to lend their works because Britain&#x2019;s relations with France, traditionally difficult, were particularly strained in 1900.2<br><br>Russia had pride of place at the Exposition as France&#x2019;s favored ally. The Russian exhibits were huge and scattered in several different locations, ranging from a massive palace in the style of the Kremlin dedicated to Siberia to a richly decorated pavilion named in honor of the Tsar&#x2019;s mother, Empress Marie. Visitors could admire, among much else, a map of France made in precious stones which the Tsar, Nicholas II, had sent as a present to the French and marvel at the sheer extent of the Romanovs&#x2019; possessions. The French themselves did not have their own pavilion; the whole Exposition was after all designed to be a monument to French civilization, French power, French industry and agriculture, and French colonies, and room after room in the different special exhibits was devoted to French achievements. The French section of the Palais des Beaux-Arts was, said the guide, naturally a model of good taste and luxury. The Exposition marked the reassertion by France that it was still a great power, even though only thirty years previously it had been utterly defeated as it had tried to prevent Germany coming into existence.<br><br>The Universal Exposition was nevertheless, the French declared, a &#x201c;symbol of harmony and peace&#x201d; for all of humanity. Although the more than forty countries exhibiting in Paris were mainly European, the United States, China, and several Latin American countries also had pavilions. As a reminder though of where power still lay, a large part of the Exposition was given over to colonies where the European powers showed off their possessions. The crowds could marvel at exotic plants and beasts, walk by replicas of African villages, watch craftsmen from French Indochina at their work, or shop in North African souks. &#x201c;Supple dancing girls,&#x201d; said an American observer severely, &#x201c;perform the worst forms of bodily contortions known to the followers of Terpsichore.&#x201d;3 Visitors came away with a comfortable assurance that their civilization was superior and that its benefits were being spread around the globe.<br><br>The Exposition seemed a suitable way to mark the end of a century which had started with revolutions and wars but which now stood for progress, peace and prosperity. Europe had not been entirely free of wars in the nineteenth century but they had been nothing to compare with the long struggles of the eighteenth century or the wars of the French Revolution and later those of Napoleon which had drawn in almost every European power. The wars of the nineteenth century had generally been short&#x2014;like the one between Prussia and the Austrian Empire which had lasted for seven weeks&#x2014;or colonial wars fought far from European soil. (The Europeans should have paid more attention to the American Civil War which not only lasted for four years but which gave an early warning that modern technology and the humble barbed wire and spades were shifting the advantage in war to the defense.) While the Crimean War in the middle of the century had involved four European powers, it was the exception. In the Austro-Prussian War, the Franco-Prussian, or the Russo-Turkish the other powers had wisely stayed out of the conflict and had done what they could to build peace again.<br><br>In certain circumstances war was still seen as a reasonable choice for nations if they could see no other way to obtain their goals. Prussia was not prepared to share control of the German states with Austria and Austria was determined not to concede. The war that followed settled the issue in Prussia&#x2019;s favor. Resorting to war was costly but not excessively so. Wars were limited both in time and in their scope. Professional armies fought each other and damage to civilians and to property was minimal, certainly in light of what was to come. It was still possible to attack and win decisive victories. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870&#x2013;71, though, like the American Civil War, hinted that armed conflict was changing: with conscription, armies were bigger, and better and more accurate weapons and increased firepower meant that the forces of the Prussians and their German allies suffered large casualties in the opening attacks on the French. And the surrender of the French army at Sedan did not end the fighting. Instead the French people, or large sections of it, chose to fight on in a people&#x2019;s war. Yet even that had finally ended. France and the new Germany had made peace and their relations had gradually mended. In 1900 the Berlin business community sent a message for the opening of the Exposition to the Paris Chamber of Commerce, wishing success to &#x201c;this great undertaking, which is destined to bring the civilized nations of the world nearer to one another in the labours common to them all.&#x201d;4 The large numbers of German visitors who were expected to go to Paris would, so many in Germany hoped, help to build better relations between the peoples of their two countries.<br><br>All the peoples of the earth have worked on the Exposition, said the special Hachette guide: &#x201c;they have accumulated their marvels and their treasures for us to reveal unknown arts, overlooked discoveries and to compete with us in a peaceful way where Progress will not slacken in her conquests.&#x201d; The themes of progress and the future ran throughout the Exposition, from the new moving pavements to the cinema in the round. At one of the pavilions, the Ch�teau d&#x2019;Eau, with its cascading waterfalls, shooting fountains, and colored lights playing on the waters, the centerpiece in a giant basin was an allegorical group which represented Humanity led by Progress advancing towards the Future and overthrowing the rather odd couple of Routine and Hatred.<br><br>The Exposition was a showcase for individual countries but it was also a monument to the most recent extraordinary achievements of Western civilization, in industry, commerce, science, technology, and the arts. You could see the new X-ray machines or be overwhelmed, as Henry James was, by the Hall of Dynamos, but the most exciting discovery of all was electricity. The Italian Futurist artist Giacomo Balla later called his daughters Luce and Elettricit� in memory of what he saw at the Paris Exposition. (A third daughter was Elica&#x2014;Propellor&#x2014;after the modern machinery he also admired.) Camille Saint-Sa�ns wrote a special cantata in praise of electricity for the Exposition: Le Feu c�leste with orchestra, soloists and choir was performed at a free concert. The Palace of Electricity was ablaze with 5,000 light bulbs and high on the summit of its roof stood the Fairy of Electricity in her chariot drawn by a horse and dragon. And there were dozens more palaces and pavilions devoted to the important activities of modern society, among them machinery, mining and metallurgy, chemical industries, public transportation, hygiene, and agriculture.<br><br>There was still more, much more. The second modern Olympic Games took place nearby in the Bois de Boulogne as part of the Exposition. Sports included fencing (where the French did very well), tennis (a British triumph), athletics (American dominated), cycling and croquet. At the Exposition Annexe in Vincennes you could examine the new motorcars and watch balloon races. Raoul Grimoin-Sanson, one of the earliest film directors, went up in his own balloon to film the Exposition from above. As the Hachette guide said, the Exposition was &#x201c;the magnificent result, the extraordinary culmination of the whole century&#x2014;the most fertile in discoveries, the most prodigious in sciences, which has revolutionized the economic order of the Universe.&#x201d;<br><br>In light of what was to come in the twentieth century such boasting and such complacency seem pitiful to us, but in 1900 Europeans had good reason to feel pleased with the recent past and confident about the future. The thirty years since 1870 had brought an explosion in production and wealth and a transformation in society and the way people lived. Thanks to better and cheaper food, improvements in hygiene, and dramatic advances in medicine, Europeans were living longer and healthier lives. Although Europe&#x2019;s population went up by perhaps as much as 100 million to a total of 400 million, it was able to absorb the growth thanks to increased output in its own industry and agriculture and imports from around the world. (And emigration acted as a safety valve to avoid an even more dramatic increase&#x2014;some 25 million Europeans left in the last two decades of the century for new opportunities in the United States alone and millions more went to Australia or Canada or Argentina.)<br><br>Europe&#x2019;s cities and towns grew as people moved from the countryside in increasing numbers in search of better opportunities in factories, shops and offices. On the eve of the French Revolution in 1789, Paris had some 600,000 inhabitants; by the time of the Exposition, 4 million. Budapest, the capital of Hungary, showed the most dramatic increase: in 1867 it had 280,000 inhabitants and by the time of the Great War, 933,000. As the numbers of Europeans making a living from agriculture went down, the industrial working classes and the middle classes grew. Workers organized themselves into unions, which were legal in most countries by the end of the century; in France the number of workers in unions went up fivefold in the fifteen years before 1900 and was to reach 1 million just before the Great War. In recognition of the increasing importance of the class, the Exposition had exhibits of model houses for workers and organizations for their moral and intellectual development.</p><h2>Dark Fire</h2><p>It is 1540 and the hottest summer of the sixteenth century. Matthew Shardlake, believing himself out of favour with Thomas Cromwell, is busy trying to maintain his legal practice and keep a low profile. But his involvement with a murder case, defending a girl accused of brutally murdering her young cousin, brings him once again into contact with the king&#x2019;s chief minister - and a new assignment... The secret of Greek Fire, the legendary substance with which the Byzantines destroyed the Arab navies, has been lost for centuries. Now an official of the Court of Augmentations has discovered the formula in the library of a dissolved London monastery. When Shardlake is sent to recover it, he finds the official and his alchemist brother brutally murdered - the formula has disappeared. Now Shardlake must follow the trail of Greek Fire across Tudor London, while trying at the same time to prove his young client&#x2019;s innocence. But very soon he discovers nothing is as it seems...</p><p>C.J Sansom was educated at Birmingham University, where he took a BA then a Ph.D. in history. DARK FIRE is his second novel, following on from his stunning debut, DISSOLUTION.Matthew Shardlake, the marvelous hunchbacked 16th-century attorney who first appeared in Sansom's <i>Dissolution</i>, returns in this spellbinding Tudor-era tale of murder, conspiracy and betrayal. Shardlake normally handles property cases and the occasional dangerous mission for Lord Thomas Cromwell, the king's high counselor. Now he is engaged to defend a young woman accused of a curious murder, and the case seems hopeless. The girl refuses to speak and, under English law, unless she offers a plea in court she will be slowly crushed to death. Cromwell offers Shardlake a two-week stay of execution if he will agree to undertake a secret mission. Desperate to save the girl's life, Shardlake agrees. Rumors abound of a new and terrifying weapon called Greek Fire, and Cromwell orders Shardlake to find it, along with its secret formula and the two alchemists who possess it. Before Shardlake can even speak to the alchemists, they are brutally murdered, the formula and Greek Fire go missing, and horror and death are unleashed. Fortunately, Shardlake is aided by Jack Barak, a capable rogue working for Cromwell, and his old friend, Guy Malton, a peculiar apothecary. Sansom's vivid portrayal of squalid, stinking, bustling London; the city's wealth and poverty; the brutality and righteousness of religious persecution; and the complexities of English law make this a suspenseful, colorful and compelling tale. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His suspenseful descriptions here of air combat in both wars is unsurpassed. The emphasis is on the extraordinary restrictions imposed on American pilots in the latter conflict and how they responded. When two of his pilots inadvertently strafed a Soviet freighter in 1967, Broughton tried to shield them from official ire by destroying the gun-camera record of the event. All three pilots were charged by their commanding general with conspiracy against the U.S. government and kept in the isolation ward of the psychiatric facility at Clark airbase in the Philippines. "The whole thing was so absurd," writes Broughton, "that you had to laugh to avoid numbing bitterness." There are many laughs in this book, for its author, in common with other fighter pilots, has a guffaw-provoking way with words; but this account is foremost an indictment of civilian and military mismanagement of the air war in Vietnam by leaders who, as Wolfe puts it in the foreword, "wasted them shamefully by not letting them fight hard enough ." In the final section the author presents an outraged account of the court-martial that followed. Photos. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.According to Broughton, the Vietnam War was fought on two fronts. The overt conflict was with Hanoi, but Broughton contends that the real struggle was with Washingtonbase of an administration determined to control the war in detail and served by a duplicitous and bureaucratized Air Force establishment. Broughton, deliberately and proudly unsophisticated, knew only one way to fightno holds barred at the sharp end; but his superiors, military and civilian, were concerned with managing violence. Failure to resolve the tensions between these approaches contributed as much as other more obvious factors to America's debacle. Recommended.

By the author of Life Is Good and Christmas Is Good.</p><p>Trixie Koontz, a good dog, was trained by Canine Companions for Independence to assist people with disabilities. Released from service because of elbow surgery, she went to live with Dean and Gerda Koontz. The successful author of three books, Trixie would be proud to know that her royalties are donated to CCI to pay medical bills for other assistance dogs.Dean Koontz's beloved golden retriever, Trixie (who died in 2007), follows her two books of wisdom (2004's <i>Life Is Good!</i> and 2005's <i>Christmas Is Good!</i>) with this volume about finding happiness by emulating dogs. Her advice includes living in the now, enjoying each moment to the fullest; putting aside worries about things one can't control; loving unconditionally and striving to make others happy; and accepting loss. Teryn McKewin reads Trixie's words in a voice brimming with good humor and pure delight in life&#x2014;perfect for a golden retriever&#x2013;and just a slight guttural quality in the back of her throat, probably meant to convey that this voice can growl and bark as well. Her playful and optimistic tone perfectly matches Trixie's personality and message, and makes this a great choice both for dog lovers and those who enjoy uplifting and reassuring books like the Chicken Soup series. <i>A Hyperion hardcover.

Now, former President Bush and his national security advisor, Brent Scowcroft, tell the story of those tumultuous years.<br><br>Here are behind-the-scenes accounts of critical meetings in the White House and of summit conferences in Europe and the United States, interspersed with excerpts from Mr. Bush's diary. We are given fresh and intriguing views of world leaders such as Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin, Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Kohl, and Fran�ois Mitterrand--and witness the importance of personal relationships in diplomacy. There is the dramatic description of how President Bush put together the alliance against Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. There are the intensive diplomatic exchanges with Beijing following the events of Tiananmen Square, and the intricate negotiations leading up to German reunification. And there is the sometimes poignant, sometimes grim portrayal of Gorbachev's final years in power.<br><br>A World Transformed is not simply a record of accomplishment; Bush and Scowcroft candidly recount how the major players sometimes disagreed over issues, and analyze what mistakes were made. This is a landmark book on the conduct of American foreign policy--and how that policy is crucial to the peace of the world. It is a fascinating inside look at great events that deepens our understanding of today's global issues.</p><p>George Bush's term as President occurred during a watershed era for international politics. In fact, so many major events took place on his watch that he limits <i>A World Transformed</i> to the years 1989 to 1991, in which the massacre at Tiananmen Square, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the Persian Gulf War held center stage. Though some will claim that this narrow focus only confirms Bush's disproportionate interest in foreign rather than domestic affairs, the events in question certainly warrant a book of their own. Perhaps anticipating such a response, Bush hints in the introduction that further memoirs are in the works.<p> <i>A World Transformed</i> is divided into three voices: Bush, his coauthor and former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, and the collective "we" of the National Security Council (supplying vital background information and a wider view of the events discussed). Overall, this formula works--Bush's tone is particularly warm and chatty, his narrative peppered with telling anecdotes that reveal the personalities and emotions behind the bold-faced headlines. His remarks are mostly to the point, gratifyingly lucid, and often compelling. Diary excerpts supply many memorable insights, if few truly shocking revelations. For instance, at the end of the Persian Gulf War, he wrote: "Isn't it a marvelous thing that this little country will be liberated.... The big news, of course, is this high performance of our troops--the wonderful job they've done; the conviction that we're right and the others are wrong. We're doing something decent, and we're doing something good; and Vietnam will soon be behind us.... It's surprising how much I dwell on the end of the Vietnam syndrome."</p><p> In describing his interaction with other world leaders, Bush emerges as a skillful negotiator and statesman, fostering a personal, first-name-basis style of diplomacy that proved especially effective with Mikhail Gorbachev and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Scowcroft, the consummate support man and workaholic, focuses more on the nuts and bolts, balancing out their presentation of how crises are dealt with at the highest level. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>"In a strong new book, the ex-president recalls dangerous days...It should leave little doubt how lucky we were that we had such a seasoned hand on the tiller at a time when foreign policy really counted."<br>--Michael R.

Clay is one of the very first materials 'invented' by man. An essential part of our lives it has been moulded, thrown, glazed, decorated and fired for over 30,000 years in order to preserve and transport food and water.

From a delicate bowl made by an unnamed artisan in China in the third millennium BC, or a jug made in eighteenth-century Dresden, to a plate made by Picasso in 1952, a 'spade form' made by Hans Coper or the vases of Grayson Perry today, it's all in included in this beautifully illustrated collection.

Our actions have driven Earth into a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. For the first time in our home planet&#39;s 4.5-billion year history a single species is dictating Earth&#39;s future. To some the Anthropocene symbolises a future of superlative control of our environment. To others it is the height of hubris, the illusion of our mastery over nature. Whatever your view, just below the surface of this odd-sounding scientific word, the Anthropocene, is a heady mix of science, philosophy, religion and politics linked to our deepest fears and utopian visions. Tracing our environmental impact through time to reveal when humans began to dominate Earth, scientists Simon Lewis and Mark Maslin masterfully show what the new epoch means for all of us.</p><p>Simon L.

(Tony Hillerman) <br><br> "Riveting [and] relentless." (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>) <br><br> "[Blunt's] insights into suffering and madness give his characters their true voice." (<i>New York Times</i>)</p><p><blockquote>It gets dark early in Algonquin Bay. Take a drive up Airport Hill at four o' clock on a February afternoon, and when you come back half an hour later the streets of the city will glitter below you in the dark like so many runways. The forty-sixth parallel may not be all that far north; you can be much farther north and still be in the United States, and even London, England, is a few degrees closer to the North Pole. But this is Ontario, Canada, we're talking about, and Algonquin Bay in February is the very definition of winter. Algonquin Bay is snowbound, Algonquin Bay is quiet, Algonquin Bay is very, very cold.</blockquote> Read the evocative opening of Giles Blunt's novel and you may begin to understand why Tony Hillerman says this is the novel he wishes he'd written. Keep reading, and you may wonder why other authors haven't joined the vicarious narrative line. With devastating precision, Blunt effortlessly weaves together strands of lives both led and taken in this tiny Canadian town, limning a hauntingly paradoxical picture of isolation and community, two sides of a fragile bulwark against violence.<p> John Cardinal was taken off homicide investigation after a fruitless and expensive quest for 13-year-old Katie Pine, a Chippewa girl who disappeared from the nearby reservation. After months of insisting that Katie was no runaway, Cardinal receives the cold comfort of vindication in the form of Katie's corpse, discovered in an abandoned mine shaft. But the case, when reopened, becomes a Pandora's box of horror. Katie's body is only the first to be found, as Cardinal uncovers a pattern that links her death to those of two other children. When another boy is reported missing, Cardinal knows he is in a race against time to find the killer (so trite a phrase, while technically accurate, does radical injustice to Blunt's razor-sharp plot and eerily pragmatic balance between the cop and his prey).</p><p> His new partner, Lise Delorme, is trying to uncover her own pattern. Drafted by the RCMP to find proof that Cardinal has been accepting money from drug runner Kyle Corbett to derail the Mounties' investigations (three attempted busts good for absolutely nothing), she sifts through the minutiae of Cardinal's life. Proud father, loving husband, dedicated officer--at what price has this edifice been constructed? Suffice it to say that Cardinal's past and present link him in ironic counterpoint to those people for whom he is inevitably the bearer of bad tidings, leaving them "trying to recognize each other through the smoke and ashes" of grief.</p><p> Blunt has created a world in which every conversation can seem as ominous as the moan of the wind and the bullet-like report of shifting lake ice ("It was a new art form for Delorme, picking shards of fact from the exposed hearts of the bereaved. She looked at Cardinal for help, but he said nothing. He thought, "Get used to it."). But it is also a world whose bleak landscape is touched with unexpected humor. Witness this description of one of the many minor, but always beautifully detailed, characters who populate the novel's pages: "Arthur 'Woody' Wood was not in the burglary business to enhance his social life. Like all professional burglars, he went to great lengths to avoid meeting people on the job. At other times, well, Woody was as sociable as the next fellow." </p><p> Part police procedural, part psychological thriller, part exploration of a region's landscape and people, the novel is an astonishing, powerful hybrid-- worthy of far more than a mere 40 words of praise. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Giles Blunt wrote for television in New York City before returning to Toronto three years ago.

We&#x2019;ve set the standard that every map company has imitated but never duplicated. Our mission is to make you feel comfortable, to make you feel safe in a place where you&#x2019;ve never been before and to enable you to experience a familiar place more fully. <p>The company was founded in 1984 by Michael Brown, who had been in international publishing for many years, setting up subsidiaries for textbook publishers. In the 1970&#x2019;s, Brown traveled extensively throughout Africa, India, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Brown would take a large paper map, cut out the city center, folded it up and slip it into his pocket, thus preventing him from looking like a tourist in areas where discretion is the better part of travel. This was his tool for surviving. </p><p>After many years on the road, Brown settled back in New York and decided to start his own business, based on the adaptations he had made to maps in his travels. His goal was to give someone the ability to navigate easily in unfamiliar terrain. </p><p>He started with a new map format: the accordion fold. Such a simple idea, but at the time it was revolutionary. No more struggling to fold an awkward, oversized paper map. This new format would enable the user to blend in like a native, instead of stick out like a tourist. Brown then added lamination to ensure that the map would be a lasting tool. </p><p>More important than the format was the design of the map itself. It had to be a map that not only succeeded above and beyond any map he had used, but was esthetically appealing as well. The look of it had to be as striking as the functionality. Color was introduced in a way that was never seen before in a map - vivid purple for water, soothing gray for the background of street grids, gold to highlight elements of the map. Clarity, conciseness and convenience in a very stylish package. </p><p>Building the business was a 24 hour job. Brown sold the maps during the day, zipping around Manhattan making deliveries on his Harley Davidson. At night he packed the orders and did the design work. More titles were added, each title requiring months of research and design. </p><p>Today, STREETWISE� produces over 130 titles for major destinations, regions and countries throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and Asia. We have grown from the back of a motorcycle to selling millions of maps around the world. </p><p>Yet each title is still painstakingly researched and updated. STREETWISE� is one of the only, if not THE only map company that conducts research by walking or driving an area to ensure accuracy. After all, what good is the map if what you hold in your hands doesn&#x2019;t match what you see on the street sign? This lengthy fact checking results in superior accuracy; in effect, we&#x2019;ve done the work, now you have the adventure. </p><p>In the end, it&#x2019;s not about the map, it&#x2019;s about getting out and finding your own authentic experience wherever you go. It&#x2019;s about being in a city or a region and discovering things that you never thought you would find. You can do this if you have confidence and you have confidence if you have a great map. STREETWISE� is the great map that you need.</p></p><h2>Faith And Rationality: Reason and Belief in God</h2><p><i>Faith and Rationality</i> investigates the rich implications of what the authors call "Calvinistic" or "Reformed epistemology."

He spotlights the Elven-trained Ranger Brynn Dharielle as she quests to claim her birthright and free the nomadic To-gai from the theocratic occupation of Behren and its dark kingpriest--Yakim Douan. <p> <i>Transcendence</i> is as much the story of Brynn's quest to free the oppressed To-gai as it is the tale of their oppressors. While events in <i>Ascendance</i> are heating up, <i>Transcendence</i> introduces the Yatol leader Douan who is single-mindedly preparing for his, yes, "transcendence" wherein the leader will die to be reborn. It's the secret behind this miracle and Douan's machinations to secure his lands in preparation for the rebirth that will eventually allow Brynn to free the To-gai from the Behrenese yoke. But Brynn's quest will unleash the deadly power of an ancient ally who will test her resolve to win her people's freedom.</p><p> <i>Transcendence</i> is excellent fantasy.

As in his excellent prior work <i>The Alphabet Versus the Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image</i> (which holds that there are links between the ascendancy of patriarchy and written language and the descent of matriarchal societies and goddess-based religions), some of the concepts proposed in this book might seem a bit of a stretch. And they are&#x2014;whether or not they turn out to be factual. Shlain contends, for instance, that women essentially invented the concept of time due to their experience of menses. Whatever conclusions the reader comes to, the author exposes the underlying gender biases in so many scientific assumptions; the result is one of those books that cannot help but alter one's perceptions. A consistently engaging writer, Shlain traces the course of his own evolving ideas with what might be called a didactic wit: bold statements are first writ large, then Dr. Shlain reveals how he came upon them, frequently with colorful anecdotes that show these are questions he's been wrestling with for many years. It's difficult to tell whether this fascinating thinker will be viewed as the next Darwin or as a crank, but there's no denying this is an audacious work in the realm of evolutionary biology. <i>--Mike McGonigal</i>Leonard Shlain&#39;s earlier books were both national bestsellers.

Using the language of the elemental world, he delineates a complex human intersection and transmutes cruelty into its opposite&#x2014;a potent, lifegiving remedy.&#x201d;&#x2014;Alison Bechdel, author of <i>Fun Home</i></p><p>First published in 1999, <i>Exile &amp; Pride</i> established Eli Clare as one of the leading writers on the intersections of queerness and disability. With this critical tenth-anniversary edition, the groundbreaking publication secures its position as essential to the history of queer and disability politics, and, through significant new material that boldly interrogates and advances the original text, to its future as well. Clare&#x2019;s writing on his experiences as a genderqueer activist/writer with cerebral palsy permanently changed the landscape of disability politics and queer liberation, and yet <i>Exile &amp; Pride</i> is much too great in scope to be defined by even these two issues. Instead it offers an intersectional framework for understanding how our bodies actually experience the politics of oppression, power, and resistance. At the heart of Clare&#x2019;s exploration of environmental destruction, white working-class identity, queer community, disabled sexuality, childhood sexual abuse, coalition politics, and his own gender transition is a call for social justice movements that are truly accessible for everyone.</p><p>Blending prose and theory, personal experience and political debate, anger and compassion, <i>Exile &amp; Pride</i> provides a window into a world where our whole selves in all their complexity can be loved and accepted.</p><p>An award-winning poet and essayist, Eli Clare is also the author of <i>The Marrow&#x2019;s Telling</i>.</p></p><p>Poet, essayist and activist, Eli Clare lives in Vermont where he spends time both writing and rabble-rousing.

Using such techniques as magic realism, allegory, and surrealism, the authors re-imagine the cliches of supernatural fiction, focusing on female characters and treating traditional themes in inventive and provocative ways. Among the authors included are Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Luisa Valenzuela, Leonora Carrington, Barbara Burford, and Joanna Russ.<br></p><p>A woman bumps into her imaginary childhood companion at the airport; telepathy bridges the 5000 miles and a generation gap that separate a rural German housewife and a Chicago college student; an overweight black girl soars to freedom in her dreams; a conservative Edwardian woman is urged to marry by her future daughter, a flapper; the Virgin Mary invites the caresses of a black man; a hyena tries to pass as a debutante; a middle-aged professional meets, and learns to accept and cherish, the needy child within her. Salmonson, a seasoned writer and anthologist of fantasy and the supernatural, gathers 24 stories, written between 1850 and 1988, by U.S., English and Latin American women. While occasionally archaic or conventional in format, the selections are a superb introduction to the vast, often obscured supernatural genre in its varied permutations: Gothic romance, ghost story, allegory, etc. This searching documentation of female alienation and suppression persuasively demonstrates how supernatural fiction intentionally subverts patriarchal notions, and links the literature to the constancy of feminist social and political struggle. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."A superb introduction to the vast, often obscured supernatural genre." <b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>"Fans of supernatural fiction will find [a] treat in <i>What Did Miss Darrington See?</i>" <b><i>Utne Reader</i></b><br><br>"[An] excellent theme anthology from the leading American publisher of historic women's writing." <b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>"A superb introduction to the vast, often obscured supernatural genre." &#x2015;<strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>"Fans of supernatural fiction will find [a] treat in <em>What Did Miss Darrington See?</em>" &#x2015;<strong><em>Utne Reader</em></strong><br><br>"[An] excellent theme anthology from the leading American publisher of historic women's writing." &#x2015;<strong><em>Booklist</em></strong></p><h2>REALMS OF INFAMY (Forgotten Realms Anthology)</h2><p>From the secret annals of Realms history come these never-before-published tales of infamy, featuring the most nefarious villains of that magical world -- Artemis Entreri, Manshoon of Zhentil Keep, Eliath Craulnober, Zulkir Szass Tamm, and many others -- told by your favorite authors, including: Ed Greenwood, R.A.

As he himself noted, "I write about animals because I love to draw them. Most of my animal characters have human personalities, and some are much like the people I know."<br><br>At Walt Disney, where Bill Peet worked for 27 years, he was a key participant in the production of classic films such as Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and 101 Dalmatians for which he was not only an artist, but the screenwriter as well. <br><br>Bill Peet&#x2019;s signature style enabled him to create fast-paced stories of fantastical adventure delivered with warmth and laugh-out-loud hilarity. His unfailing humor did not, however, prevent him from addressing such poignant issues as kindness toward others and respect for the environment. Through the exploits of his characters, Peet offered his audience a chance to see themselves and their world through new eyes.<br><br>"At some point," Bill Peet once said, "it occurred to me that drawing was something I couldn&#x2019;t possibly give up, and somehow it must be turned into a profession."

An intense, behind-the-scenes look at rock music in the gritty, post-glam era, Neon Angel is a must-read for anyone whose heart beats to the rhythm of David Bowie, Suzi Quatro, Nick Gilder, and the Sex Pistols, and for every fan of the movie it inspired: <em>The Runaways</em>, starring Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart as Cherie Currie and Joan Jett.</p><p><p>Cherie Currie, with her signature Bowie haircut and fishnet stockings, was the groundbreaking lead singer of '70s teenage all-girl rock band the Runaways. At the tender age of fifteen, she joined a group of talented girls&#x2014;Joan Jett and Lita Ford on guitar, Jackie Fox on bass, and Sandy West on drums&#x2014;who could play rock like no one else.</p><p>Arriving on the Los Angeles music scene in 1975, they catapulted from playing small clubs to selling out major stadiums, headlining shows with opening acts like the Ramones, Van Halen, Cheap Trick, and Blondie. Currie lit up the stage with the provocative teen-rebellion songs "Cherry Bomb," "Queens of Noise," and "Born to Be Bad," riding a wave of hit songs and platinum albums, all while touring around the world.</p><p>On the face of it, Currie's is a riveting story of girl empowerment and fame. But it is also an intensely personal account of her struggles with drugs, sexual abuse, and violence. She and her bandmates, runaways all, were thrown into a decadent, high-pressure music scene where on the road, unsupervised for months at a time, they had to grow up fast and experience things that no teenage girls should. <em>Neon Angel</em> exposes the side of the music industry fans never get to see, and chronicles the group's rise to fame and their ultimate demise. </p><p>Shocking and inspiring, funny and touching, <em>Neon Angel</em> stunningly re-creates a bygone era of rock and roll, all the while providing an inside look at growing up hard under the relentless glare of the public eye, and chronicling one tough woman's fight to reclaim her life.</p><p>Cherie Currie has been described as "the lost daughter of Iggy Pop and Brigitte Bardot." Shortly after the Runaways disbanded, the rock star landed a coveted role in the Jodie Foster movie <em>Foxes</em>, and later went on to appear in a number of other films. Currie is still performing, writing, and acting, and she continues to take on unorthodox endeavors. One of the most prominent chain-saw carvers in the world, she placed in two major competitions in 2005. She lives in California with her son, Jake.</p><br><br><p>Tony O'Neill is the author of <em>Digging the Vein</em> and <em>Down and Out on Murder Mile</em>, and the coauthor of <em>Neon Angel</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Hero of the Underground</em>.

This book examines Eastern mythology as it developed into the distinctive religions of Egypt, India, China and Japan.</p><p>Joseph Campbell was interested in mythology since his childhood in New York, when he read books about American Indians, frequently visited the American Museum of Natural History, and was fascinated by the museum's collection of totem poles. He earned his B.A. and M.A. degrees at Columbia in 1925 and 1927 and went on to study medieval French and Sanskrit at the universities of Paris and Munich. After a period in California, where he encountered John Steinbeck and the biologist Ed Ricketts, he taught at the Canterbury School, then, in 1934, joined the literature department at Sarah Lawrence College, a post he retained for many years. During the 1940s and '50s, he helped Swami Nikhilananda to translate the Upanishads and <b>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</b>. The many books by Professor Campbell include <b>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</b>, <b>Myths to Live By</b>, <b>The Flight of the Wild Gander</b>, and <b>The Mythic Image</b>. He edited <b>The Portable Arabian Nights</b>, <b>The Portable Jung</b>, and other works.

The Twinkie stands for all that is right and, perhaps, wrong with American processed food. The author examines each of the ingredients of the Twinkie, starting from the most common all the way to the unlisted less than 1 percent additives, such as color. He also examines where each ingredient comes from. Its a delicious lesson in organic chemistry, world trade, and gastronomic history. Mark Lund narrates with enthusiasm. He warms to the subject, and his tone engages listeners. He could have rendered the book as stale as a Twinkie past its sell-by date. Instead, like his topic, he is bouncy and fresh.

They are all available in Signet editions, as is the magnificent statement of her artistic credo, <i>The Romantic Manifesto</i>.Both those inspired and those irritated by Rand's radical individualism will find support for their response in her journals. Sympathetic readers will enjoy sketches of unfinished projects, philosophical fragments, essays and testimony about communists in Hollywood, and extensive notes for her two major novels. Harriman's (Philosophy/Claremont Graduate School) sycophantic but helpful comments guide the reader through the unpublished material of an unwavering proponent of individualism and capitalism who is not afraid to condemn altruism or dismiss democratic authority with scorn. Indeed, the ease with which she labels most people ``parasites'' suggests that Rand was born too soon: Her self-confident dismissals of all who disagree would have made her a phenom on Crossfire or talk radio. Others will be struck by what is absent here: For Rand there are no open questions. She explicitly started ``with a set of ideas'' and then studied ``to support them.'' An instinctual antipathy to collectivism born of a childhood spent under communist rule established the substance of the writer's worldview, and her subsequent intellectual activity involved communicating convictions rather than exploring them. Fiction provided an outlet for this ideological single-mindedness, allowing her version of reality to be presented through fantasy worlds shorn of anything inconsistent with her beliefs. To demonstrate how individualism and collectivism work ``in real life'' and acceptance of a flawed concept such as charity results when we depart ``from facts,'' Rand wrote novels representing, she said, ``the kind of world I want.'' Even when recognizing that her idealization of the defendant in an actual criminal trial was probably inaccurate, she claimed that it ``does not make any difference,'' for even if he was not as she perceived him, ``he could be, and that's enough.'' This volume reveals not only how strong conclusions can flow from trumping fact with fiction, but also why Rand seemed to be living on another planet. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The amount of sarcasm Clint could put into shocked silence wasn't illegal. Yet. But Kaylin had to grudgingly admit, as she glared her way past his lowered halberd and into the Halls of Law, the wings he extended were a nice touch.<br><br>The Aerie was almost empty, but it usually was at this time of day; the halls themselves were suspiciously quiet. Then again, maybe the Swords were actually earning their pay instead of milling around the halls looking smug. Even on her bleariest mornings, Kaylin couldn't have missed the tension and worry that seemed to permeate the city streets recently, and keeping the peace, such as it was in a crowded city, was <i>their </i>job. For a change. The day was already looking brighter. She glanced up as a shadow passed her, and saw a lone Aerian traversing the space high above; he wasn't practicing maneuvers, and his wings were extended for a steady glide. She still envied the Aerians their wings, a little.<br><br>She felt a smidgen of sympathy for the Swords but didn't let it show. Much. It wasn't often that the entire city had almost created a new sea coast by the simple expedient of being under most of the surrounding water. She was certain that stories and rumors about the larger-than-Imperial-edict tidal wave that had almost destroyed the harbor&#x2014;for a start&#x2014;had already been making the rounds, and growing bigger, if that was even possible, with each telling.<br><br>She was waved through&#x2014;without sarcasm&#x2014;when she approached the guards that separated the Hawks' quarters from those of the Wolves or the Swords. The halls were vacant, and even the duty roster seemed to have gathered no darts.<br><br>"Oh, come on, guys," she said, when the entire office stopped as she entered and approached Marcus's desk. "I'm not <i>always </i>late. Don't you have anything better to do?"<br><br>"Have you checked the duty roster, dear?" Caitlin asked, from the safety of her desk. Not that she was ever in any danger; if the office had a collective mother, it was Caitlin.<br><br>"Oh. No." She turned and, at Marcus's bark of a command, turned back. Marcus's growl was low, and it was short. He must be tired. And a tired Leontine was generally best kept happy by little displays of obedience. Or big ones.<br><br>The paperwork on his desk hadn't really diminished but also, to Kaylin's admittedly inexpert eye, hadn't grown; the emergency that had pulled a number of his Hawks out of their normal routine had been resolved; there was no Festival for almost another year. She couldn't quite see what would put him in a mood, but the fact that he was in one was obvious&#x2014;having facial fur that bristled when you were ticked off was a dead giveaway. Having fangs that were almost as long as her fingers&#x2014;the exposed parts of the fangs, at any rate&#x2014;was another.<br><br>She came to stand a safe distance from the side of his desk, and waited. She even waited quietly.<br><br>Her reward? He lifted a stack of paper off his desk and dumped it in her hands. "This," he said curtly, "is your problem."<br><br>She looked down at what she had assumed were reports&#x2014; or worse. The paperwork required of the office was, by all accounts, more arcane than any of the magic it also required. To punctuate this, the window very sweetly told the entire office what the hour was.<br><br>Kaylin really hated the window. There was money riding on how long it would take someone to accidentally break it, and money riding on who would have the accident. There weren't many rules that governed office bets, but one of them was that you couldn't place money on yourself. Which was fair but, in Kaylin's case, prevented her from winning much.<br><br>"Well? Are you going to stand there all day?"<br><br>Kaylin looked down at the first sheet in the stack&#x2014;and it was a large stack. "No, sir."<br><br>"Good. Take note of the roster&#x2014;your rounds have been changed."<br><br>"Since when? I checked it last night."<br><br>"Since then, obviously."<br><br>She caught Caitlin's frantic gestures out of the corner of her eye, and nodded. She considered going to the roster by way of Caitlin's desk, but since they were in opposite directions and Marcus could watch you while his back was turned, she decided to actually go to the roster instead.<br><br>Her shoulders did a severe downturn when she saw what had been written beside her name. Even Severn's name, at the same location, didn't bring much cheer. The Imperial Palace?<br><br>"Don't make that face," Teela said, in her left ear.<br><br>Barrani could walk in perfect silence, but it took work, and Teela was usually too damn lazy. Kaylin's little start did not, however, cause her to drop the bundle of paper. Given Marcus's mood, that was good.<br><br>"What's eating Marcus?"<br><br>Teela shrugged, long black hair rising and falling like a perfect curtain. Kaylin tried not to resent the fact that the Barrani weren't governed by any Hawk regulations when it came to anything they wore. Regulations were, after all, supposed to be practical and as far as Kaylin could tell, Barrani hair never tangled, never got caught in anything, and never got in the way.<br><br>And they were gorgeous and lived forever. If it weren't for the fact that they adored politics&#x2014;preferably with blood and death&#x2014;they'd be insufferable.<br><br>"He's Ironjaw," Teela said. "But he's been in that mood since late last night." Her tone of voice made it clear that it was serious enough that Kaylin should change the subject <i>now, </i>and Kaylin had known Teela for so many years it wasn't possible to misinterpret.<br><br>"Figures. Save a city, get sent to the Imperial Palace."<br><br>"It's more impressive than being sent to the docks or the Commons."<br><br>"More people to offend."<br><br>"True, and some of them are significant." Teela smiled. In all, it wasn't a happy expression. "Have you even taken a look at what you're holding?"<br><br>"I just got it, Teela."<br><br>"You might want to read it over," the Hawk replied. "Severn's waiting in the West room. And so is the Dragon."<br><br>The Dragon was generally known by the rank and file as Lord Sanabalis. One of Four Dragon Lords that comprised the Dragon contingent of the Imperial Court, he was also a member of the Imperial Order of Mages. He had graciously come out of teaching retirement to take on one pupil, that pupil being Kaylin herself. She tried to remember to be grateful, and usually succeeded when she wasn't actively staring at a candle wick in a vain attempt to get it to catch fire.<br><br>Which, come to think, was most of the time.<br><br>But she knew her lesson schedule more or less by heart now, and none of those lessons started at the beginning of her day. Given her nocturnal activities, and the desire of the Hawks not to annoy the mages, Marcus had forbidden any lesson that started before lunch. It gave her a decent chance of not missing any.<br><br>So Sanabalis wasn't here to teach her anything new about candles. She pushed the door open&#x2014;it was open, so she didn't have to go through her daily ritual of teeth-grinding<br><br>while waiting for the doorward to magically identify her&#x2014; and saw that Severn and Sanabalis were seated across the room's only table, talking quietly.<br><br>They stopped when they saw her, and she slid between the door and its frame, dropping the stack of paper on the tabletop.<br><br>"Marcus is in a mood," she told Severn.<br><br>"It's better than yours."<br><br>"I'm not in a&#x2014;" She stopped. "You mean better than mine will be?"<br><br>"Pretty much. Take a seat. Lord Sanabalis is here to inform us of our duties, and to escort us to the man we'll be aiding."<br><br>When Severn spoke Barrani, it was generally a bad sign. Lord Sanabalis, on the other hand, almost always spoke in Barrani.<br><br>"We don't have to talk to the Emperor, do we?" she said, sinking into the chair slowly. It was rock hard and weighed more than she did.<br><br>"No," Lord Sanabalis replied. "Unless something goes gravely, gravely wrong, the Emperor has more important duties to attend."<br><br>"Does this mean there's no lesson today?"<br><br>"There will be, as you say, no lesson for the course of your duties at the Palace."<br><br>"Well, that's something. Who are we investigating?"<br><br>Severn hesitated.<br><br>"Investigating?" Sanabalis replied, raising a brow. "I rather think, if you were sent to investigate someone, the last place the Hawks would agree to second you would be the Imperial Palace. As you <i>should </i>know, the Imperial Guards deal with any difficulties that arise in the Palace. And they do not arise."<br><br>"Yes, Sanabalis." She hesitated. "What are we doing there, then? We're not exactly guard material&#x2014;"<br><br>One of his silver brows rose into his thinning hairline.<br><br>Fair enough; if the Imperial Guard would be offended at outside investigators, they would probably completely lose it at outside <i>guards. </i>"So we're not there as investigators, we're not there as guards. Are we there as Hawks?"<br><br>"In a manner of speaking."<br><br>She grimaced. "That usually means no."<br><br>"You are Hawks or you could not be seconded in this fashion. You are not, however, there as representatives of the Law."<br><br>The old bastard looked like he was enjoying himself. Exactly how he conveyed this, Kaylin wasn't quite certain&#x2014;his expression was neutral enough, and his voice was smooth as glass.<br><br>"So what are we there as?"<br><br>"As Cultural Resources," he replied smoothly.<br><br>"As what?"<br><br>"Cultural Resources."<br><br>"I heard you. What exactly does that mean?"<br><br>"Ah. Have you taken a moment to peruse the documents you placed upon the table?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"I'd advise you to do so. We are not expected at the Palace until after lunch. I felt, given the unpredictability of your schedule, that this was wisest."<br><br>"But&#x2014;"<br><br>"Many of the questions you are no doubt impatient to ask will be answered by even the briefest of perusals."<br><br>She wondered if he were a betting man, or Dragon. But given Dragons in general, she doubted it.<br><br>"If it eases your mind, Private Neya, Sergeant Kassan <i>is </i>required to pay you for the time you spend seconded to the Palace. He also," he continued, lifting a hand to stop her from speaking, "expects you to report in each morning.<br><br>"For some reason, he is concerned about the assignment. I can't imagine why."<br><br>"Act One, Scene One." Kaylin looked at Severn. <i>"Act One, Scene One?"</i><br><br>"It's a play," Severn said, shrugging slightly. The left corner of his mouth was turned up in something that hinted at amusement. "You're familiar with plays?"<br><br>Kaylin snorted. She read the description of stage materials&#x2014;mostly the painted facades of buildings and bushes, in different sizes. And, she thought, in odd colors. "Poynter's road?"<br><br>Severn nodded. "It's&#x2014;"<br><br>"I know where it is&#x2014;but the buildings don't look anything <i>like </i>that on Poynter's."<br><br>"Kaylin&#x2014;"<br><br>"No, Corporal Handred, allow her to speak freely. It will, in theory, get it out of her system."<br><br>"You want me to read a play?"<br><br>"Not exactly. The play itself is not complete, or not complete to our satisfaction. The author's name might be familiar to you." He raised one brow.<br><br>"Richard Rennick." She looked at Severn. "Should we know him?"<br><br>"He's the Imperial Playwright," Severn told her quietly. "The position is held by one Playwright every five years. There's usually a competition of some sort&#x2014;a series of different plays staged for the Emperor. He apparently won, three years ago."<br><br>Lord Sanabalis said, "The Emperor feels that human arts should be encouraged. Don't look at me like that, Kaylin. Dragons seldom have an interest in drama."<br><br>"Who's the judge of this contest?"<br><br>"The Emperor."<br><br>"So the winner is the person who appeals most to someone who doesn't even like plays?"<br><br>"Something very like that," he replied.<br><br>"And you want us to... work with this Rennick?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"Perhaps you should read more than three pages."<br><br>She grimaced. "Sanabalis&#x2014;"<br><br>"Lord Sanabalis," Severn corrected her.<br><br>"Lord Sanabalis, then. What on earth do I know about plays?"<br><br>"Clearly nothing." He frowned. "However it is not for your expertise in the dramatic arts that you have been seconded."<br><br>"Go on."<br><br>"It is for your expertise&#x2014;such as it is&#x2014;on the Tha'alani."<br><br>It was Kaylin's turn to frown, but some of the exasperation left her, then. "I'm not an expert," she told him quietly.<br><br>"No. But the Tha'alani seconded to the Court would possibly be even less comfortable in an advisory role."<br><br>"If they can't&#x2014;" She stopped. "Why has the Emperor commissioned a play about the Tha'alani?"<br><br>Lord Sanabalis didn't answer. But she met his eyes; they were their usual placid gold. His lower membranes, however, were up.<br><br>"It's because of&#x2014;of the water, isn't it?"<br><br>"The tidal wave."<br><br>"That one."<br><br>"Yes. I am not aware of how much you saw, or how much you read about after the fact&#x2014;but the Tha'alani, led by their castelord, left their Quarter in larger numbers than the city has ever seen. They walked to the docks, and they spread out along the port and the seawall. When the waters began to shift&#x2014;and it was dramatic, Kaylin, even to one who has seen as much as I have&#x2014;"<br><br>"You weren't there," she told him, but the words were soft. "You were with us."<br><br>"I accessed records when I returned to the Palace." He was now using his teacher tone of voice.<br><br><i>And I didn't, </i>Kaylin supplied. She glanced at Severn, who nodded very slightly. She cleared her throat. It was still hard for her to think about the Tha'alaan, and the Tha'alani <i>were </i>the Tha'alaan in some ways. "They hoped to save the city, if the waters rose."<br><br>"Yes. But I invite you to think about appearances, Kaylin."<br><br>"The wave didn't hit the city."<br><br>"No. It did not. The Oracles, however, were not widely bandied about. For many people&#x2014;for almost all of them&#x2014; the first warning of danger was the sight of the water itself, rising.

More than 900 million viewers followed the chilling, twenty-hour event on television, as German authorities desperately negotiated with the terrorists. Finally, late in the evening, two helicopters bore the terrorists and their surviving hostages to Munich&#x2019;s little-used F�rstenfeldbruck airfield, where events went tragically awry. Within minutes all of the Israeli athletes, five of the terrorists, and one German policeman were dead. <br><br> Why did the rescue mission fail so miserably? And why were the reports compiled by the German authorities concealed from the public for more than two decades? Reeves takes on a catastrophe that permanently shifted the political spectrum with a fast-paced narrative that covers the events detail by detail. Based on years of exhaustive research, <i>One Day in September</i> is the definitive account of one of the most devastating and politically explosive tragedies of the late twentieth century, one that set the tone for nearly thirty years of renewed conflict in the Middle East.</p><p>In the early hours of September 5, 1972, members of the ultraviolent Palestinian terrorist faction Black September scaled the perimeter fence surrounding the Olympic Village in Munich. Their target was the temporary home of the Israeli Olympic team. Within 24 hours, 11 Israelis, five terrorists, and a German policeman were dead.<p> Based largely on exhaustive investigation for the Oscar-winning documentary, <i>One Day in September</i> is the definitive account of the tragedy. Simon Reeve has gathered extraordinary information from a number of sources, including recently released Stasi files and interviews with key figures, including the families of the hostages, politicians, policemen, advisors, fellow athletes, media figures, and even the lone surviving member of the group that carried out the attack. Reeve's control over his material is admirable. He vividly paints images of the individuals involved, humanizing a narrative that cracks and buzzes with the compact tension of those 24 hours. At the same time, he provides the background to the attack, filling in vital historical context from the distant and recent past, such as the Arab-Jewish dispute that produced this and other terrorist actions and their responses.</p><p> Reeve conveys the public horror of Jews being incarcerated on German soil, which led the German authorities to make crucial judgments, with tragic results. Fatal errors were made that can only be fully understood through the underlying dynamics of not only Middle East history, but also postwar European politics, individual and institutional arrogance, inexperience, and political pressure--including from the International Olympic Committee. Reeve follows up the events of that day by exposing the full extent of the Israeli revenge mission, which over the next 20 years hunted down and killed those responsible for the attack. He has not only written a compelling book, but provided a considerable service in allowing readers to understand the forces of hatred and history that conspired toward inevitable, but no less tragic human consequences.</p><p> Those who were a part of the huge live media audience that watched helplessly as events unfolded will undoubtedly experience again the sense of dread at recalling those traumatized, shackled figures led out from the Olympic Village to their fate on a German airfield. Those who make the mistake of thinking the dark days of international terrorism are history will read <i>One Day in September</i> and remember that the same underlying tensions still cast shadows over our present and our future. <i>--Fiona Buckland, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>&#34;In the early hours of 5 September 1972 the perimeter fence surrounding the Olympic Village in Munich was scaled by terrorists. Their target was the temporary home of the Israeli Olympic team, and within 24 hours seventeen men were dead: eleven Israelis, five terrorists and a German policeman. The attack by Black September, an ultra-violent faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was seen on television by more than 900 million viewers. The world watched as Jews suffered again on German soil. Yet despite the immediate attention given to the disaster crucial questions went unanswered. Why did so many die? And why have German officials covered up details of the massacre? Based largely on exhaustive investigations for the film One Day in September, this book is the definitive account of the massacre. With the help of previously secret documents, photographs and dozens of interviews, it reconstructs the tension of the day - and exposes the full extent of the Israeli &#39;Wrath of God&#39; revenge mission, which over the next twenty years saw Israeli agents systematically murder their way across Europe and the Middle East. One Day in September is the most compelling account yet written of events in Munich, of the devastating impact the attack had on the relatives of terrorists and athletes alike - and of the long shadow the massacre still casts over the modern world.&#34; One Day in September was published in 2000 by Faber and Faber in Britain, Arcade in the USA, and by Penguin in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. It has also been published and sold in a number of other countries around the world. The film One Day in September, narrated by the actor Michael Douglas, won the Oscar for Best Documentary.</p><h2>Norman Vincent Peale: Three Complete Books: The Power of Positive Thinking; The Positive Principle Today; Enthusiasm Makes the Difference</h2><p>Author of the greatest inspirational bestseller of our time offers positive strategies for success in business and personal life.

Bentley's Philip Trent--as well as stories from Sapper, Edgar Wallace, Somerset Maugham, Aldous Huxley, and A.E.W. Mason. And, of course, this volume would not be complete without Sherlock Holmes, who makes his appearance in three classic cases.<br> With little-known stories by famous authors, and ingenious works by almost-forgotten writers, <em>Detective Stories from the Strand</em> is a treasure trove of remarkable ingenuity, guaranteed to delight all enthusiasts of crime fiction.<br></p><p><br><em>About the Editor</em>: <strong>Jack Adrian</strong> is the author of several thrillers as well as war and science fiction novels. An authority on this century's popular and genre fiction, he has compiled a number of anthologies and single-author collections, and has edited E.F. Benson, and <em>Desirable Residences and Other</em> <em>Stories</em>.<br>It flourished for well over half a century and was one of the most popular magazines of its time, but what will be forever remembered about the Strand magazine is that it published the very first Sherlock Holmes story--and many more thereafter. This well-balanced collection of detective fiction from its pages (a similar anthology, of weird and macabre stories, Strange Tales from the Strand Magazine , will appear simultaneously) accepts that identification gracefully, with Holmes represented by three adventures and Ronald Knox's famed pastiche "The Adventure of the First Class Carriage." Nor are the bits of Sherlockiana standard stuff, including "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton," in which the Great Detective not only allows a murderer to escape punishment but commits a crime of his own, and the controversial "The Adventure of the Lion's Mane," told by Holmes himself rather than by Dr. Watson. Other famous sleuths appeared in the pages of the Strand as well, and editor Adrian includes Agatha Christie's "The Dream," a Hercule Poirot story (rather more obvious than most, unfortunately), and the only Father Brown tale to appear there, G. K. Chesteron's "The Vampire of the Village." Ninteen additional stories, by authors famous (Somerset Maugham, Aldous Huxley, Edgar Wallace) and mostly forgotten (sic Seamark, Richard Keverne, Loel Yeo) round out an anthology of material not generally available elsewhere and thus of significant appeal to aficionados. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>WARHAMMER The Game of Fantasy Battles</h2><p>The game is designed for regiments of fantasy miniatures. It uses stock fantasy races such as humans (The Empire, Bretonnia, Kislev), Elves (Dark Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves), Dwarfs, Undead, Orcs and Goblins, as well as some more unusual types such as Lizardmen, Skaven and the daemonic forces of Chaos. Each race has its own unique strengths and flaws; Wood Elves, for example, have the most powerful archers in the game but have poor overall defence and Bretonnia have the strongest cavalry but weak infantry.</p><p></p><h2>Robogenesis: A Novel</h2><p><b>The stunningly creative, epic sequel to Wilson's blockbuster thriller and <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Robopocalypse</i></b><br> <br> "The machine is still out there. Still alive."<br> <br> Humankind had triumphed over the machines. At the end of <i>Robopocalypse</i>, the modern world was largely devastated, humankind was pressed to the point of annihilation, and the earth was left in tatters . . . but the master artificial intelligence presence known as Archos had been killed.<br> <br> In <i>Robogenesis</i>, we see that Archos has survived. Spread across the far reaches of the world, the machine code has fragmented into millions of pieces, hiding and regrouping. In a series of riveting narratives, <i>Robogenesis</i> explores the fates of characters new and old, robotic and human, as they fight to build a new world in the wake of a devastating war. Readers will bear witness as survivors find one another, form into groups, and react to a drastically different (and deadly) technological landscape. All the while, the remnants of Archos's shattered intelligence are seeping deeper into new breeds of machines, mounting a war that will not allow for humans to win again.<br> <br> Daniel H. Wilson makes a triumphant return to the apocalyptic world he created, for an action-filled, raucous, very smart thrill ride about humanity and technology pushed to the tipping point.</p><p>DANIEL H. WILSON was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma and earned a B.S. in computer science from the University of Tulsa and a Ph.D. in robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He is the author of <i>Amped, Robopocalypse</i>, <i>How to Survive a Robot Uprising</i>, <i>Where's My Jetpack?</i>, <i>How to Build a Robot Army</i>, <i>The Mad Scientist Hall of Fame</i>, and <i>Bro-Jitsu: The Martial Art of Sibling Smackdown</i>.1. Parasite<br><br>New War: Final Minutes<br><br>In the last moments of the New War, the enemy Archos R-14 resorted to ruthless tactics. As exhausted allied soldiers finally reached the Ragnorak Intelligence Fields where Archos R-14 had buried itself, they were met with a nasty counterattack: scuttling, crablike machines that mounted the bodies of fallen soldiers. With titanium limbs buried in dead or dying flesh, soldier corpses rose again. These parasites dealt terrible damage to the bodies and minds of the living . . . but what was left behind when the battle ended was Archos R-14&#x2019;s most horrific contribution to the True War.<br><br>--Arayt Shah<br><br>NEURONAL ID: LARK IRON CLOUD<br><br>There was no way to win this war and we all knew it, but we marched anyway.<br><br>I shove my checkerboard scarf deeper into my parka and hold my breath. Kneeling on the ice-kissed turf, I brace against a tree and press the cold rims of binocular-enhanced goggles against my face. The situation has well and truly gone to shit here in the godforsaken woods of western Alaska.<br><br>The New War started when a thinking machine we call Big Rob turned our tools against us. In the madness of Zero Hour, some of us in Oklahoma found refuge with the Osage Nation. We survivors fell back to the rural town of Gray Horse and counted our lucky stars. But the machines evolved. Over months and years they crossed the Great Plains, slithered through the waving grass, and climbed our stone bluffs.<br><br>So we fought then. And we fight now.<br><br>Our bullets are chasing each other through black tree branches, tracers streaking like falling stars. The last lines of our walking tanks are arrayed defensively, spotlights glowing bright in the twilight, each four-legged hulk a pool of light spaced a half klick from its brothers and hunkered down to provide cover for ground forces. Dark enemy fire is whining out of the woods like mosquitoes. Most of their rounds are a flesh-burrowing variety called pluggers, but waves of exploding crawlers called stumpers are also skittering toward us.<br><br>Letting the goggles flop on my neck, I get moving. My collar radio is hissing with cavalry calls from squads scattered over the rough countryside. Scrambling low through the trees, I ignore the clipped cries for help and head toward Beta squad. There are no reinforcements. There is nothing left now but metal and snow and blood.<br><br>&#x201c;Come in, Lonnie,&#x201d; I pant into my radio. &#x201c;You there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; comes the reply.<br><br>The voice is measured and calm. It belongs to Lonnie Wayne Blanton, an old cowboy who happens to be our general. The man is important to me. He saved my life and put me on the right path and now I&#x2019;m trying to figure out how in the hell to tell him that it was all for nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;All squads pinned down. Things are royally fucked. Moving to support Beta.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Roger,&#x201d; says Lonnie. A pause. &#x201c;Hold on. Long as you can.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I radio back. &#x201c;Thank you for everything.&#x201d;<br><br>We made it this far only by reverse-engineering the enemy&#x2019;s weapons. Gray Horse Army was able to march to within a thousand-mile perimeter of Big Rob. We left our blood splashed in the woods and we kept on marching. We broke the five-hundred-mile perimeter over the screaming of fallen soldiers. And here at the one-hundred-mile perimeter our force has splintered and broken and now we have lost everything.<br><br>All we have left to fight for now is each other.<br><br>Ducking stray fire, I close in on Beta squad&#x2019;s position. The soldiers are back-to-back at the edge of a clearing. Most are lost in the dusky light, but I see right away that my brainboy Carl is on his ass. The engineer is whimpering and clawing and kicking his way backward through the snow.<br><br>&#x201c;Carl,&#x201d; I shout. &#x201c;On your feet.&#x201d;<br><br>I lean for him and he keeps moaning and struggling. He is under my command, but my soldier won&#x2019;t look at me and he won&#x2019;t take my hand and I can&#x2019;t figure out why until I notice his eyes.<br><br>Not where he&#x2019;s looking. But where he won&#x2019;t look.<br><br>Something black crawling low and fast on too many legs. And another one. They&#x2019;re starting to come up from under the snow by the dozens.<br><br>Too late.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t feel the pincers at first. Just this strong pressure on the base of my neck. I&#x2019;m in a hydraulic-powered bear hug. I spin around in the slushy snow but there&#x2019;s nobody behind me.<br><br>Whatever-it-is has climbed up my back and got a good hold. My knees sag with the lurching weight of it. Crooked black feelers reach around my chest and my spine is on fire as the thing decides to dig in, a bundle of squirming razor blades. This is a whole new hell I&#x2019;ve never felt before.<br><br>Shit shit shit--what is this that it hurts so damn much?<br><br>Carl&#x2019;s got his frost-plated rifle up, training it on me. The gun strap hangs stiff and crusty in the arctic breeze. Around us, my soldiers are screaming and dancing in tight, panicked circles, trying to shake off their own monsters. Some are running. But me and the engineer are having our own little moment here.<br><br>&#x201c;Carl,&#x201d; I wheeze. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>My voice sounds hollow from the pain of whatever has gotten between my shoulder blades. Judging from Carl&#x2019;s blank face, I figure that I&#x2019;m not in a very happy spot. No, sir. That is a full-on nega-tory.<br><br>Carl lets go of his rifle entirely and the strap catches on his forearm. He stumbles away, gun dangling. Wipes his eyes with shaking fingers, tendons streaking the backs of his hands. His complicated engineering helmet falls off and thunks into the snow, just an empty bowl.<br><br>&#x201c;Lark,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Ah, Lark, I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;s crying. I could give a shit.<br><br>I&#x2019;m being flayed alive, straining and groaning against black spider legs gripping my body, doing drunken pirouettes in the slush. Knotty black arms are slicing into the meat of my thighs, sprouting smaller feelers like barbs. Others grip my biceps, elbows, forearms, and even my fingers.<br><br>I am in command but I am most definitely not in control. Some of my soldiers are still thrashing in the shadows. Some aren&#x2019;t. The wounded are crawling and hobbling away as fast as they can, coiled black shapes slicing toward them like scorpions.<br><br>Dammit, I&#x2019;m sorry, Lonnie.<br><br>Carl has hightailed it. Left his ostrich-legged tall walker behind--the scavenged two-legged mount is collapsed on its side, its jerry-rigged saddle nosed into the snow and long legs splayed out awkwardly. The soldier has gone and left all of us unlucky dancers behind.<br><br>My legs are wrapped too tight now to struggle. A motor grinds as I push against it, reaching back with my arm. I feel a freezing fist-sized plate of metal hunkered in the soft spot at the base of my neck. Not good.<br><br>The machine snaps my arm back into place.<br><br>Can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m real sure of what happens next. I got a lot of experience breaking down whatever hardware Big Rob left on the battlefield, though. After a while, you get a feel for how the machines think. How they use and reuse all those bits and pieces.<br><br>So I imagine my guess is pretty accurate.<br><br>I hear a neat click and feel a sharp sting at the base of my neck. Watch the vapor of my last breath evaporate as the parasite on my back jerks and severs my spinal column with a flat, sharpened piece of metal mounted to its head region. My arms and legs go numb, so much dead meat. But I don&#x2019;t fall, because the machine&#x2019;s arms and legs are there to hold me up.<br><br>And I don&#x2019;t die.<br><br>Some kind of cap must fit over the nub of my spine, interfacing with the bundle of nerves there. This is a mobile surgery station leeched onto my neck and digging into my brain. Humming and throbbing and exploring, it&#x2019;s clipping veins and nerves and whatever else. Keeping oxygen in my blood, circulating it.<br><br>I&#x2019;m spitting cherry syrup into the snow.<br><br>Lonnie Wayne Blanton, my commander, says that this late in the war you can&#x2019;t let anything the enemy does surprise you. He says Big Rob cooks up a brand-new nightmare every day and he&#x2019;s one hell of a chef. Yet here I am. Surprised, again.<br><br>The machine is really digging in now. As it works, my eyes and ears start blurring and ringing. I wonder if the scorpion can see what I see. Hear what I hear.<br><br>I&#x2019;m hallucinating in the snow.<br><br>A god-sized orange line of smoke roils across the pale sky. It&#x2019;s real pretty. Smaller streams fall from it, pouring down like water from drain spouts. Some of the streams disappear behind the trees, others are even farther away. But one of them twists down and drops straight at me. Into my head.<br><br>A line of communication.<br><br>Big Rob has got me. The thinking machine called Archos R-14 is driving the pulsing thing on my back. A few dozen klicks from here, the architect of the New War has dug itself into a hole where that fat orange column of radio transmission starts. It&#x2019;s pulling all our strings.<br><br>I watch as my dead arms unsling my rifle. Tendons in my neck creak as the machine twists my head, sweeps my vision across the clearing. I&#x2019;m alone now and I think I&#x2019;m hunting.<br><br>In the growing twilight, I spot dozens of other orange umbilical cords just like mine. They fall out of the sky and through grasping branches. As I lurch forward out of the clearing, the other lines drift alongside me and keep pace.<br><br>All of us are being dragged in the same direction.<br><br>We&#x2019;re a ragged front line of dark shapes, hundreds strong, shambling through the woods toward the remnants of Gray Horse Army. The world begins to fade in and out as my cooling body slogs between the trees. The last thing I remember thinking is that I hope Lonnie Wayne doesn&#x2019;t see me like this. And if he does, well, I hope he puts me down quick.<br>I don&#x2019;t hear the gunshot itself, just a dry echo in the trees. It&#x2019;s something, though. Enough to wake me up.<br><br>I dreamed I was breathing.<br><br>Focus, Lark. Don&#x2019;t panic. As I think, the wires of my parasite start to move my legs. Carry me in the direction of the gunshot in slow, dragging steps. Over the charred earth of a battlefield. I pass by a titanic spider tank, leaning still and cold and heavy against a snowbank. Its armor is pocked with sooty craters, intention light shattered, joints cracked open like lobster claws. The word Houdini is scrawled on it.<br><br>And the bodies.<br><br>Frozen bodies are melded with the snow. Stiff uniforms and frostbitten metal. The occasional alabaster patch of exposed frozen flesh. I recognize most of the corpses as Gray Horse Army, but pieces of some other army are here, too. Bodies of the ones who came and fought before we ever knew Archos R-14 existed. From the state of the bodies and wreckage, I gather that two or three weeks have gone by since I lost my squad.<br><br>That impossible orange smoke in the sky is gone. Now I&#x2019;m in control of the parasite on my back, telling it to move my arms and legs instead of the other way around. I can think of only one explanation: Big Rob is dead.<br><br>The New War is over and we must have won, for what it&#x2019;s worth.<br><br>Remnants of battle are imprinted on the land. Starbursts of scorched rock streak from the husks of bunkered spider tanks--walking weapons that once stalked the battlefield, spewing fire. Wind-eaten corpses are frozen solid and left in clumps where squads of brother soldiers made their final stands. Welts in the ice glimmer, carved by the men with flamers who clung to the shelter of the tree line while swarms of stumpers crawled in from the blizzard.<br><br>And among the trees at the edge of the clearing, I see the others. A cluster of a dozen or so walking corpses that stand huddled, shoulder to shoulder. Silent. Some are still in full uniform, normal-looking save for the clockwork parasites clinging to their backs. Others are worse off: A woman is missing her leg, yet she stands steadily on the narrow black limb of the parasite. One man is shirtless in the cold, skin wind-blasted to a marbled corpse-sheen. All of them are riddled with puckered bullet holes. Cratered exit wounds, frozen flaps of skin and torn armor.<br><br>And I see another, freshly killed.<br><br>A still form lying in the snow. Its head is missing, pieces scattered. A parasite lies on its back nearby, coated in rusty blood, slowly flexing its mouthpieces like a squashed bug. The thing is dying, without a host.<br><br>That gunshot I heard served a purpose.<br><br>The survivors have one combat shotgun left between them. A big man, stooped over from his own size, has got the gun now. Most of his face is hidden in an overgrown beard, but I can see his mouth is round and open--a rotten hole. He&#x2019;s moving slow because frostbite has taken all his fingers, but I figure out pretty quick where he&#x2019;s going with that barrel.<br><br>They&#x2019;re taking turns killing themselves.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I try to shout, but it comes out a shapeless sob. &#x201c;No, this is wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>I shuffle faster, weaving between shredded bodies trapped in permafrost like quick-set concrete. None of the survivors pays me much attention. They&#x2019;re keeping their faces aimed away from the big man, even as they edge close enough to grab the shotgun when it falls.<br><br>The bearded man is looking up at the sky. So he doesn&#x2019;t understand what&#x2019;s happening when I nudge the butt of his gun. His blackened nub of a thumb presses the trigger and the gun thunders and leaps out of his hands. Pieces of bark and a puff of snow drift down from the trees overhead. The slug missed.<br><br>Those great black eyes turn to me, mottled with frost, and understanding sets in. With an angry moan, the big man swings at me. His frozen forearm hits like an aluminum baseball bat, propelled by black robotic musculature. It chips off a piece of my elbow, knocks me off balance. Now I see I&#x2019;m missing part of my torso. My guts are gone and my center of gravity is off. Guess I&#x2019;m not the steadiest corpse alive.<br><br>I drop hard into the snow.<br><br>The guy lifts his leg, his long tendons snapping like frozen tree branches, and drops a boot into my stomach cavity. Rib fragments scatter in the snow among shreds of my clothing and flesh. The beard keeps stomping and moaning, destroying my already ruined body in a slow-motion rage.<br><br>And I can&#x2019;t feel a damn thing.</p><h2>American Freemasons: Three Centuries of Building Communities</h2><p><p>With over four million members worldwide, and two million in the U.S., Freemasonry is the largest fraternal organization in the world. Published in conjunction with the National Heritage Museum, this extravagantly illustrated volume offers an overview of Freemasonry&#x2019;s origins in seventeenth-century Scotland and England before exploring its evolving role in American history, from the Revolution through the labor and civil rights movements, and into the twenty-first century. <strong>American Freemasons</strong> explores some of the causes for the rise and fall of membership in the fraternity and why it has attracted men in such large numbers for centuries.</p><p><strong>American Freemasons</strong> is the perfect introduction to understanding a society that, while shrouded in mystery, has played an integral role in the lives and communities of millions of Americans.</p><p>Copublished with the National Heritage Museum</p></p><p><p><b>Mark A. Tabbert</b> is Director of Collections at the George Washington Masonic National Memorial in Alexandria, Virginia and the former Curator of Masonic and Fraternal Collections at the National Heritage Museum in Lexington, Massachusetts. His work has appeared in <i>The Northern Light</i>, <i>Heredom</i>, and <i>American Studies</i>.</p>This slender history begs the question: who is really qualified to write about secret societies? Tabbert, a Master Mason, doubts the "ability" of non-Mason historians to "fully understand the craft" since they "have not actually witnessed the rituals performed" within the society. His personal investment, however, makes his volume sound so defensive at times, even emotive, that his lavishly illustrated history of U.S. Masonry-from its Revolutionary origins to its currently moribund dotage-reads more like an apology for, or a love letter to, the society than a work of measured, scholarly rigor. The opening chapter recounts, in compelling detail, Masonry's European germination in the hotbed of the Enlightenment. But the second chapter initiates Tabbert's book-long habit of overstating Masonry's centrality to U.S. history-and its virtue. For example, while the "quarrelsome man" who threatened to publicly expose Masonic rituals in 1826 is vilified as a "restless, jack-of-all trades drifter," the faceless criminals who kidnapped and killed him (severely tarnishing Freemasonry's reputation in America) are given the author's reprieve: "What actually happened remains a mystery, but most likely he was killed by his abductors either accidentally or in a fit of passion." The book makes a strong case for the Masons' outward missions of civility, charity and community-building. Also notable is its attention to the Prince Hall Order of African-Americans. Yet can the institution's 40-year decline in membership really be blamed on such "social earthquakes" as television, shopping malls, "teenage drug use and pregnancy"? Maybe the lodge is an "anachronism," as Tabbert says, but his claim that Masons "are almost completely incapable of entering into a conspiracy (except to do good) or keeping a secret (except in hiding private acts of kindness)" appears disingenuous nonetheless. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But someone will do <em>anything</em> to ensure the truth remains hidden forever. <br><br></p><p>Marta Perry realized she wanted to be a writer at age eight, when she read her first Nancy Drew novel. A lifetime spent in rural Pennsylvania and her own Pennsylvania Dutch roots led Marta to the books she writes now about the Amish. When she&#x2019;s not writing, Marta is active in the life of her church and enjoys traveling and spending time with her three children and six beautiful grandchildren. Visit her online at www.martaperry.com.Link Morgan narrowed his focus to the heavy sledgehammer and the satisfying thwack it made when it broke into the old paneling.<br><br>The paneling shattered beneath Link's sledgehammer, its shoddiness a contrast to the solid double-plank construction of the rest of the old farmhouse. Setting the sledgehammer down, he pulled fragments loose with gloved hands, tossing them into a pile in front of the fireplace. The last bit of the section came free, revealing what lay behind it.<br><br>He stared, methodically wiping the sweat from his forehead. Shaking off the foreboding that gripped him, he reached into the wall and pulled out the object that lay there. A suitcase. Not empty, by the feel of it.<br><br>Carrying it to the makeshift worktable, he set down his find. An inexpensive suitcase, its fabric sides coated in dust and marred by stains. How long had it lain there, inside the wall of Uncle Allen's house? More important, why was it there?<br><br>He snapped open the latch and swung back the lid. Women's clothes, by the look of it&#x2014;slacks, a skirt, several blouses. Beneath them something black. He picked it up, shook it out and recognized it. An Amish woman's black apron. His stomach twisted, rebelling the way it had in Afghanistan when they were coming upon a perfect place for an ambush.<br><br>Taking out the apron revealed what lay under it: a white Amish prayer kapp. At the very bottom was a framed photograph. He picked up the picture, bad feelings growing. A woman and a young girl, looking at each other, faces lit with laughter and love. Mother and daughter, he'd guess from the similarities in the faces. The child looked to be about four or five.<br><br>He set the picture down gently and took a step away from the table. Something was wrong here. The pair in the photo wore typical, though a little outdated, clothing. So how did that square with the Amish clothing in the suitcase? The pressure that had driven him for months urged him to ignore this, to get on with his plans. Whatever had led to this suitcase being placed inside the wall of the old house his uncle had left him, it was no concern of his.<br><br>If he hadn't opened the suitcase, maybe he could have bought that. But the contents raised too many questions. Too late now to take the easy way out. He pulled the cell phone from his pocket and dialed the Spring Township police.<br><br>Ten minutes later a police car pulled into the driveway. The occupants got out and headed for the back door, as country people always did, and he walked out to the back porch to meet them. Before he had a chance to speak, his brother Trey's pickup drew to a stop behind the cruiser.<br><br>He'd called Trey right after he'd called the police, figuring he would want to know. After all, he was the one who'd been here for the past six years while Link was off at college and then in the army. Maybe he'd be able to shed some light on this, but even if he couldn't, Trey was the kind of person you turned to when there was trouble.<br><br>Besides, Trey knew everyone. Adam Byler, now the township police chief, had been friends with Link's big brother since they were kids, running around together, usually trying to brush off Link, the bratty little brother tagging after them and getting into trouble.<br><br>"Hey, Link." Adam pulled off sunglasses and started toward him, followed by another cop...Dick McCall, fiftyish, balding, with a paunch that strained his uniform shirt a bit more each year. Mac had been a township cop when Link had been soaping windows at ten.<br><br>"Sorry to call you out." Link leaned against the porch post, hoping it didn't look as if he needed its support. "It's probably nothing, but I figured you'd want a look at this."<br><br>"No problem. That's what you pay taxes for, right?" Adam punched his shoulder lightly, the tap a hint of the power that lay behind it. Adam was as solid now as he'd been in high school, with not an ounce of fat on his muscular frame. "Let's have a look."<br><br>Trey joined them, giving Link the worried look he'd been using since Link got out of the military hospital and came home to recuperate.<br><br>"What's up?" Trey's voice was so much like Dad's that it still shocked Link sometimes. "Adam said you found something inside the wall of the addition."<br><br>He jerked a nod and headed inside. "See for yourself."<br><br>The family room, stretching across the rear of the centuries-old farmhouse, seemed smaller with four men in it. They stood in an awkward circle around the opened suitcase.<br><br>Adam took the photo, setting it so they all could see. He glanced at Link. "You know who the woman is?"<br><br>Link shook his head, frowning at a vague memory that teased at the back of his mind. "The face seems a little familiar, but that's all."<br><br>"Yeah, me, too," Trey said, sounding annoyed with himself that he didn't have the answer.<br><br>Mac picked up the photo. "You three boys are too young to remember, that's all. It's Barbara Angelo, that's who it is."<br><br>"Angelo." The frown on Adam's stolid face deepened. "Wasn't there a scandal or something about her?"<br><br>"Ran off from her husband and kid, that's the way I heard it." Mac looked gratified at their attention.<br><br>"Russ Angelo, the husband, said she'd gone back to Indiana to her family, leaving the little girl with him and his mother. Barbara was Amish, see, left the church to marry him, but the marriage didn't work out." He shrugged. "It happens. Nobody questioned her leaving all that much, as I recall."<br><br>"But if her suitcase is here..." Trey let that trail off.<br><br>No point in going on. Trey was thinking what they were all thinking. If Barbara Angelo had deserted her husband and small daughter, what was her suitcase doing in the wall of Allen Morgan's house?<br><br>Adam closed the suitcase, scanning the sides with his eyes, not touching. "No ID tags. The kind of cheap bag you could pick up at any discount store."<br><br>To Link's eyes, the bag looked worn and battered, but maybe that was just the effect of being inside the paneling all these years. It was thick with dust, splattered with darker stains and a few nicks here and there.<br><br>Adam seemed to scan the stains more closely, then looked around the room. "Where was it?"<br><br>"Right here, next to the fireplace." Link showed them, concentrating on not limping as he crossed the room. Maybe that sledgehammer had been a bit much. The army said he was as well as they could make him, after what had happened in Afghanistan.<br><br>Adam squatted down, studying the area as deliberately as he did everything. "Well, it's not a crime to put a suitcase inside a wall. You two know when this work was done?"<br><br>"We were kids when Uncle Allen built the addition, that's as close as I can come," Trey said. "Mom would know exactly, though."<br><br>Adam let his gaze move around the room. "I hate to say it, but I think we'd best make sure there's nothing else inside that paneling." He shot a glance at Link. "You mind?"<br><br>"Hey, I'm tearing it off anyway. I'll take any help I can get. One thing's sure&#x2014;if there is anything, it has to be in this room. The rest of the house has solid double-plank walls. Not room even for a mouse."<br><br>Let alone a human body, if that's what they were talking about.<br><br>"Well, let's have at it." Trey picked up the sledgehammer before Link could reach it. He managed a grin at Link. "You sure this isn't just a ploy to get us to do the work for you?"<br><br>"How else would I get you to do it? You're still dead set against my selling the old place, aren't you?" Link softened the question with an attempted smile, but he'd be glad if everyone would stop hovering over him.<br><br>"I just wish you'd stick around for a while, that's all," Trey said. He punctuated the words with a swing of the sledgehammer. "Seems like Morgans belong here in Lancaster County."<br><br>Trey didn't understand this drive of Link's to leave&#x2014;that was clear. Link wasn't sure he understood it himself, but life had to be easier someplace where people weren't worrying about him all the time. A buddy of his was keeping a job for him in California. He had a simple plan: renovate the house, sell it, move to California and forget what had happened to his team in Afghanistan and the career he'd once thought to have in the military.<br><br>With four of them working, the job didn't take long. Soon all the old paneling lay in dusty stacks on the floor.<br><br>"Nothing." Adam summed it up, brushing off his hands. "Maybe that's what the whole thing amounts to. I guess there could be some innocent explanation for the woman's suitcase being inside the wall of your uncle's house."<br><br>"Can you think of one?" Trey challenged. Link could hear the worry in his voice. He'd be thinking about how Mom would take this.<br><br>"Not off the top of my head," Adam admitted. "But that doesn't mean there isn't one. Still, crime or no crime, I guess I'd better look into it." He shrugged.<br><br>"Sorry."<br><br>That was aimed at both him and Trey, Link supposed. After all, it had been their uncle's house. There would be talk, speculation about the possible relationship between Allen Morgan and the Angelo woman. Adam might want to keep it quiet, but they all knew how impossible that was in a place like Spring Township.<br><br>Link picked up the photograph, looking into the big brown eyes of the little girl, feeling again that sense of something wrong he'd had the first time he looked at her face, reminding him of those other children who saw death and destruction everyday. Stronger than that&#x2014;it was a sense of empathy, as if the child meant something to him.<br><br>"One thing I do know," he said. "This kid, or rather, the woman she is now&#x2014;she deserves to know what happened to her mother."<br><br>Marisa Angelo felt as if she hadn't taken a breath since she left Baltimore. Cutting the car engine, she stared at the house in front of her. It stood on the fringe of the village of Springville, but still gave the illusion of privacy, hidden as it was behind a hedge of lilac bushes so high that nothing could be seen from the road.<br><br>Marisa got out slowly, pushing the strap of her bag onto her shoulder, unable to take her gaze from the house. It was probably like a hundred other farmhouses in this rural area of Pennsylvania; a two-story white frame with black wooden shutters on the windows. But instead of being surrounded by neat flowerbeds, it hid behind overgrown trees, its windows shielded by blinds so that it seemed to sleep.<br><br>A shiver slid through her. She was being morbid. She shouldn't let this experience get to her. From the moment the police chief called her, after being unable to reach her father, she'd been focused on one thing only: get here. Find out what this place had to do with the disappearance of her mother that had left a hole in her heart nothing seemed to fill. She'd packed a bag, collected the materials she needed for her current set of illustrations, and set off.<br><br>She'd been five when her mother left, six when she and her father and grandmother moved to Baltimore. This area ought to be familiar to her, but she seemed to have only fragments of memories that didn't amount to anything&#x2014;an image of herself jumping rope on a sidewalk, the scary feeling of standing onstage in what must have been an elementary-school program.<br><br>They'd left, they'd never come back, she'd forgotten this place, even though her dreams were haunted by the need to know. To understand what happened.<br><br>Gradually, over the past few years, when every line of inquiry came up empty, she'd thought she was accepting the fact that she'd never know. But when the call came, it was as if she'd been waiting for it all her life.<br><br>She closed the car door and walked toward the house. Blank and shuttered, it looked deserted, but someone must be here. The police chief had said the owner was renovating the place. Seeming to understand her need to see for herself, Chief Byler had agreed to meet her here.<br><br>She had one foot on the porch step when she heard the noise&#x2014;a steady series of thuds coming from the rear of the building. Maybe the renovator was still at work.<br><br>The yard behind the house proved just as secluded as the front. A stand of pines pressed close, reaching over a fieldstone wall to threaten a garage and a couple of outbuildings that tilted into each other in a dispirited manner. The source of the noise was instantly obvious.<br><br>The man, in jeans and a T-shirt, worked steadily, oblivious to her presence. Pick up a short log, set it on a stump, split it with an axe, toss it aside. His movements were smooth, efficient and almost angry in their intensity.<br><br>From the top of the stone wall, a large black cat watched with the casual indifference of its kind. He put up a lazy paw to swipe his face, his eyes never leaving the figure.<br><br>The contrast between the lean ferocity of the man and the lazy feline grace of the cat had her fingers itching. She pulled the ever-present pad and pencil from her bag, intent on capturing the scene in quick strokes. With a few changes, this might fit into the children's book she was illustrating. Even if it didn't, she couldn't resist.<br><br>The image was nearly complete when the man clutched his side with a grunt, dropping the axe. The cat vanished over the wall. She must have made some move, because the man spun and strode toward her, transferring that angry intensity from the logs to her.<br><br>"What are you doing?"</p><h2>The Only Victor</h2><p>A Richard Bolitho story, and a sequel to &#34;Honour This Day&#34;.

For more information, please visit her website at www.iihs.com.</p><p>Vimala Rodgers has taken the ancient idea that letters of an alphabet contain the energy of living spirits and brought it into the modern world. She has created a practical system, Integral Handwriting, for drawing letters in a specific and deliberate way in order to enhance the qualities that one wants to increase in his or her life.</p> <p>After a brief introduction explaining her system and how to use it, Rodgers takes us through each letter of the English alphabet individually, giving us it's related soul quality, element, gender, gemstone, animal, and guardian protector (angel). She then tells us how to write the letter in a way that will enhance these attributes.</p> <p>The book is part of a beautifully designed kit which also contains two CDs, a flash card for each letter of the alphabet, and a blank journal with unlined paper. ("Unlined paper extends an open invitation to release hidden dreams that are yours alone and allows you to become more of who you really are, playing life at the highest level.") The flash cards contain both the soul quality that Rodgers associates with the letter and an affirmation intended to increase that quality.</p> <p>The author's vibrant personality comes through on every page. There is no excess of theory. We are given the basic facts and then told to start writing and see for ourselves what happens.

He is also the author of the two bestselling trilogies about the moles of Duncton Wood, and the new &#x2018;The Wolves of Time series.</p>In a second sequel to Kenneth Grahame's classic The Wind in the Willows, Horwood (The Willows in Winter, 1994) revisits the River Bank and the beloved characters of Toad, Mole, Rat, and Badger. Portraits of loyal Mole, practical Rat, and wise Badger remain faithfully intact (in text as well as in Benson's black-and- white illustrations); however, Horwood seems captivated with Grahame's own notion of ``an altered Toad,'' and much of the plot dances around this idea. Toad's normal vanity and conceit are seen in ``alarming transmutation,'' thanks to Cupid's arrow, which has left Toad smitten and contemplating matrimony. A parallel plot bears the overriding theme of immortality, which prompts Mole and Rat to journey up river in their desire to ``get a little nearer to the mystery we have called Beyond.'' The two threads intersect at journey's end, where Toad willfully escapes ``the eternal bond'' of marriage, proving himself as irresolute as ever. The formal style of writing adequately mimics Grahame's own; that, and the sophisticated themes may be better appreciated by adults who loved the original. Nevertheless, the River Bank animals have fans who will be happy to pause awhile in such good company. (Fiction. 11+) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

King, a journalist who has unveiled the workings of the LaRouche cult almost singlehandedly over the years, here produces a courageous, hard-hitting expose. The LaRouchians raised over $200 million in loans and donations from the public, despite what the author describes as the sect's "classic fascist" ideology, anti-Semitism, brain-washing, smear tactics and fanatical support of the Star Wars defense system and military build-up. According to King, LaRouche's eccentric posturing (he claimed the Queen of England was a drug pusher and branded Henry Kissinger a communist agent) was useful cover--a pose to distract the media while LaRouche forged bonds with the Reagan administration, the CIA, the National Security Council, the Ku Klux Klan and other white-supremacist groups, Teamster bosses and crime lords, among others. King charges that the major media looked the other way, adopting a "see-no-evil" policy that allowed LaRouche to flourish. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this portrait of LaRouche and his followers, journalist King provides a case study of the development of a radical movement. He discusses LaRouche's childhood, which helped to shape LaRouche's particular world view, as well as LaRouche's strange odyssey from left-wing Marxist to right-wing leader of the reactionary National Democratic Policy Committee. King examines the bizarre coalitions--the Ku Klux Klan and black civil rights groups, for example--that LaRouche has managed to form and galvanize into political action. LaRouche has also managed to maintain ties to such disparate figures as Manuel Noriega and Teamsters' boss Jackie Presser. This is a riveting narrative about a man who would say or do anything to gain personal power and who seems to have used his blatant anti-Semitism to successfully entice followers.<br><i>- Frank Kessler, Missouri Western State Coll., St. Joseph</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>They Call Me Super Mex: The Autobiography of Lee Trevino</h2><p>An autobiographical portrait of one of the world&#39;s greatest golfers describes his struggles to overcome his humble, poverty-stricken origins to reach the heights of the golfing world and his attempts to cope with fame and success</p><p></p><h2>A moment of war</h2><p>In December 1937 a naive young Englishman slipped across the Spanish frontier to fight for the Republican cause. In the third volume of his autobiographical trilogy, which began with &#34;Cider With Rosie&#34;, Laurie Lee describes a winter fighting with the International Brigade. This is a view of the Spanish Civil War from below, a tragi-comic account of rivalry and ribaldry in the ranks. Lee&#39;s fellow volunteers were an ill-starred posse of Scots, Cockneys, Welsh miners and Frenchmen who drank, gambled and pursued women when not engaging the enemy. Lee himself fell for the ravishing Eulalia, a passionate young partisan who reappeared in his life with an almost miraculous sense of timing to ease his misfortunes. He was arrested and three times narrowly escaped execution in a war which claimed half a million lives. Reflecting on what had compelled him to fight, Lee reasoned that he had wanted &#34;the chance to make one grand gesture of personal sacrifice and faith&#34;.</p><p><b>Laurie Lee </b>was born in 1914 in Stroud, Gloucestershire, and was brought up with his mother and many siblings. At the age of nineteen he walked to London and then traveled on foot through Spain as described in <i>As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning</i>. He married Catherine Polge and had one daughter; he died in 1997.Naivet&#x17d; and modern warfare meet in the midst of the Spanish Civil War. Young Lee arrives in Spain prepared for battle though not for the skepticism nor his imprisonment. Thorne's matter-of-fact, almost conversational recital captures young Lee's trusting enthusiasm. Events, both petty and horrendous, are made credible without emotional histrionics. The reader's quiet energy gives Lee's character unspoken wonder and fear. Thorne provides well-rendered characterizations and near-perfect multi-national accents. It's a curious, yet compelling, odyssey. S.B.S.

Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.Set in 1947, Parker's superb new novel imagines what it was like for Jackie Robinson, and more centrally for Robinson's (fictional) bodyguard, to see the color barrier broken in Major League baseball. This isn't Parker's first foray outside the mystery genre, though he remains best known for his Spenser PI series (this year's (<i>Bad Business</i>, etc.); in 2001 he dramatized Wyatt Earp in (<i>Gunman's Rhapsody</i>, and earlier he excelled with <i>Perchance to Dream</i>, <i>Wilderness</i> and <i>Love and Glory</i>. In an unusual gambit, however, this time he mixes his storytelling with his firsthand reminiscences (in chapters titled "Bobby") of growing up as a devoted Dodgers fan, a move that adds resonance and a sense of wonder to the taut narrative. The fiction, told in the third person, focuses on Joseph Burke, a WWII vet grievously wounded physically and emotionally by combat and its aftermath. Burke is a hired gun who allows himself no feelings, but when he signs on with Dodger owner Branch Rickey to protect Robinson from racist violence during the ballplayer's rookie season, he comes to respect, then love, the proud, controversial player. Burke also falls for Lauren, a self-destructive society girl with mob connections whom he worked for before Robinson, and it's from Lauren's troubles and the threat of violence surrounding Robinson that the novel's hard, smart action arises. Burke is a tough guy, and the narrative not set around baseball fields takes place in the white and black underworlds as Burke plays various gangsters against one another to protect both Lauren and Robinson. Parker, always a clean writer, has never written so spare and tight a book; this should be required reading for all aspiring storytellers. Parker fans will recognize with joy many of the author's lifelong themes (primarily, honor and the redemptive power of love), and in the Burke/Robinson dynamic, echoes of Spenser/Hawk (the PI's black colleague). Here they will treasure the very essence of Parker in a masterful recreation of a turbulent era that's not only a great and gripping crime novel but also one of the most evocative baseball novels ever written. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet as the sole woman among powerful, charismatic men, someone whose personal ambition was secondary to her passion for her cause, she has received little mainstream recognition--until now. In her memoir, Dr. Height, now ninety-one, reflects on a life of service and leadership. We witness her childhood encounters with racism and the thrill of New York college life during the Harlem Renaissance. We see her protest against lynchings. We sit with her onstage as Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his "I Have a Dream" speech. We meet people she knew intimately throughout the decades: W.E.B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, Eleanor Roosevelt, Mary McLeod Bethune, Adam Clayton Powell Sr., Langston Hughes, and many others. And we watch as she leads the National Council of Negro Women for forty-one years, her diplomatic counsel sought by U.S. Presidents from Eisenhower to Clinton.<p> After the fierce battles of the 1960s, Dr. Height concentrates on troubled black communities, on issues like rural poverty, teen pregnancy and black family values. In 1994, her efforts are officially recognized. Along with Rosa Parks, she receives the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.</p></p><p><b>Dr. Dorothy Height</b> has more than twenty honorary degrees. In addition to the Presidential Medal of Freedom, she has received the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Freedom Medal and the Citizens Medal Award, which President Ronald Reagan awarded her in 1989. Now 91, she continues to serve as chair and president emerita of the National Council of Negro Women. She lives in Washington, D.C.Civil rights activist and leader Height looks back on seven decades of crucial work-as speaker, social worker, protestor; as a member of the national staff of the YWCA from 1944-1977 and president of the National Council of Negro Women from 1957-1998-in this thorough but impersonal memoir. Height reports Molotov cocktails and secret civil rights meetings in back rooms, along with more quotidian aspects of racism-being invited by mistake to rush a white sorority, for example-with the same smooth tone. Although the changes Height helped bring about were dramatic, her manner is not. To adverse events, she was creative rather than reactive: her response to a TV program called "The Vanishing Black Family," for example, was to organize the Black Family Reunion celebrations. Of particular interest is her account of her close relationship with Mary McLeod Bethune and Eleanor Roosevelt, and her restoring to the history of the Civil Rights Movement the important role played by the little-known Wednesdays in Mississippi project, in which "biracial, interfaith teams of distinguished women" held weekly meetings that established "a ministry of presence." Dignity, discretion and a certain delicacy-the very elements that made her such an effective agent for social change-make her memoir a somewhat prosaic book. It chronicles days of committees, conferences and conventions, of persistent pushing for change while working within existing structures. It is a public account of public activities, an autobiographical record with none of the intimacy of the memoir. Its value for historians of the civil rights era and of black women's organizations is central, but although Height was always there, she doesn't take the reader with her. 8 page b&amp;w photo insert not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Give Birth Like a Feminist</h2><p>As featured on BBC Radio 5 LiveBirth is a feminist issue.

To get home Dorothy must follow the yellow brick road to Emerald City and find the wonderfully mysterious Wizard of Oz. Together with her companions the Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion whom she meets on the way, Dorothy embarks on a strange and enchanting adventure.</p><p>For many of us, the adventures of Dorothy in Oz will forever be associated not with Judy Garland singing &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; but with W. W. Denslow&#39;s exceedingly odd line drawings for the original editions of Baum&#39;s Oz series. The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard. These illustrations are often cockeyed, with occasional realistic details thrown in, like a crow with a corncob in its beak in the first portrait of the Scarecrow. The characters have a poignance and oddity that escaped the makers of the Oz movie.<p>The Wizard of Oz is a beloved American classic.&nbsp; This edition, with fine illustrations from internationally acclaimed artist Lizbeth Zwerger, has been reformatted as a readaloud edition.</p></p><h2>The Art and Architecture of Islam, 1250-1800</h2><p>Virtually all the masterpieces of Islamic art - the Alhambra, the Taj Mahal, and the Tahmasp Shahnama - were produced during the period from the Mongol conquests in the early thirteenth century to the advent of European colonial rule in the nineteenth. This beautiful book surveys the architecture and arts of the traditional Islamic lands during this era.<br>Conceived as a sequel to the The Art and Architecture of Islam: 650-1250, by Richard Ettinghausen and Oleg Grabar, the book follows the general format of the first volume, with chronological and regional divisions and architecture treated separately from the other arts. The authors describe over two hundred works of Islamic art of this period and also investigate broader social and economic contexts, considering such topics as function, patronage, and meaning. They discuss, for example, how the universal caliphs of the first six centuries gave way to regional rulers and how, in this new world order, Iranian forms, techniques, and motifs played a dominant role in the artistic life of most of the Muslim world; the one exception was the Maghrib, an area protected from the full brunt of the Mongol invasions, where traditional models continued to inspire artists and patrons. By the sixteenth century, say the authors, the eastern Mediterranean under the Ottomans and the area of northern India under the Mughals had become more powerful, and the Iranian models of early Ottoman and Mughal art gradually gave way to distinct regional and imperial styles. The authors conclude with a provocative essay on the varied legacies of Islamic art in Europe and the Islamic lands in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p><p>Sheila Blair has taught at Pahlavi University in Shiraz, the University of Pennsylvania, and Dartmouth College.Intended as a standard text, this volume by the area editors of Islam for The Dictionary of Art (1980. 3d ed.) is a sequel to Richard Ettinghausen and Oleg Grabar's now classic The Art and Architecture of Islam: 650-1250 (Viking, 1988). Organized simply by chronology (with sections on 1250-1500 and 1500-1800) and then by geography (Iran and Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, Asia Minor, and India), the text focuses separately on architecture and "the arts." Each chapter concentrates on a limited number of significant objects, discussing not only stylistic and aesthetic issues but also addressing the social, historical, and economic contexts of those works. Although this book is densely written in a manner typical of survey texts and lacking the richly colored glossy reproductions of a coffee-table tome, its comprehensive coverage entitles it to become part of any library with the slightest interest in art.<br><i>Eugene C.

Narrator Mark Deakins&#39;s sonorous start reflects the dread felt by Marine Major Steve Beck as he prepares to notify a family of its loss. Deakins gives depth to all the family portraits by giving his narration full emotional power, especially in the expressive quotes. Using a tone of respect, he voices family members&#39; motions of anger and sorrow, as well as their love for those killed. Individual portrayals, like the one of the pregnant widow who spends a last night with her husband&#39;s flag-draped coffin, communicate both the grief of the families and the dedication of the soldiers who accompany them on their difficult journeys.

She lives in Phoenix, Arizona.The Answer<br><br>The first step to a happy marriage is to understand that all life is governed by law--nature, music, art, and all of the sciences. These laws are immutable. To live in harmony with them produces health, beauty, and the abundant life. To violate them brings ugliness and destruction. Just as unwavering are the laws of human relationships. These laws are in operation even though you may not understand them. You may be happy in marriage because you obey them, or you may be unhappy because you violate them without an awareness of the laws in operation.<br><br>Through ignorance of the laws of marriage relationships, much unnecessary unhappiness exists. We find one woman happy, honored, and loved; and another--no less attractive, no less admirable, no less lovable--neglected, unhappy, and disappointed. Why? This book explains why, for it teaches the laws she must obey if she is to be loved, honored, and adored.<br><br>Fascinating Womanhood<br><br>Fascinating Womanhood will teach you how to be happy in marriage. There are three essentials in reaching the goal:<br><br>1. Love: Since the cornerstone of a happy marriage is love, you will learn how to awaken your husband's love. These teachings apply, no matter what your age or situation. Love is not limited to the young or the beautiful, but to those who have qualities that awaken it.<br><br>If your husband doesn't love you, you are likely doing something to cool his affections, or have lost something which awakens his love. You may have begun marriage lovingly but romance is fading. Why? Could it be that you have changed? Take a good look. In most cases a man stops loving a woman after marriage because she stops doing things which arouse his feelings. When you regain your charming ways, love can be rekindled.<br><br>In winning your husband's love, it isn't necessary for him to know or do anything about it. This isn't to say that he doesn't make mistakes or need to improve, but when you correct your mistakes you bring about a loving response in him. Frequently his response is so remarkable that it exceeds your highest expectations.<br><br>The art of awakening a man's love is not a difficult accomplishment for women because it is based on our natural instincts. However, in our highly civilized life many of our natural instincts have become rusty due to lack of use. You need only to awaken the traits which belong to you by nature.<br><br>2. Self-Dignity: Essential to happiness in marriage is self-dignity. Does your husband ever speak to you harshly, criticize you unduly, treat you unfairly, neglect you, impose on you, or in any way mistreat you? The important thing is not what he does but how you react. Do you shrink back as if struck by a lash? Do you go into your shell? Do you pay him back with a cutting remark? Or, do you fly off the handle with an ugly temper? If you react in any of these ways you will cause yourself unnecessary grief and lessen your husband's love for you.<br><br>No man likes an ugly temper, nor does he want a woman he can walk on, or one who will retreat into her shell and feel sorry for herself. He wants a woman with some spunk--some hidden fire, a woman he can't push around. Some men even admire little spitfires, women who are adorably independent and saucy, whom they can't put down with even the most degrading remark.<br><br>In Fascinating Womanhood the method of handling wounded feelings is called childlike anger, spunk, or sauciness. It will teach you how to handle a man's rough nature without pain, without friction. You can, in a flash, turn a crisis into a humorous situation, so that the man may have the sudden impulse to laugh. Instead of hurting marriage, childlike anger can increase love and tenderness.<br><br>3. Desires: If you are to be happy in marriage your desires must be considered. I am referring to things you want to have, places you want to go, something you want to do, or something you want done for you. This is not to suggest selfish whims, but worthy desires. Unfortunately, you may have gone without these things for years because you didn't know how to motivate your husband to do these things for you.<br><br>As a consequence, his feelings for you have likely diminished. We love whom we serve. If your husband never does anything for you beyond the call of duty, he may lose his love for you. In Fascinating Womanhood you will learn how to obtain the things you need and deserve without causing a marital stir. Your husband will want to do things for you and will love you more because of it.<br><br>Although the teachings focus on building a relationship with your husband, the principles apply in building a relationship with any man--father, brother, son, teacher, student, employer. Take care, however, that you don't use them unrighteously, to win the affections of a married man. You would be guilty of a cruel sin and would destroy another woman's relationship as well as your own. In relationships outside of your marriage, apply them only to eliminate friction and to build harmony and trust.<br><br>The teachings are also helpful to the single mother who is rearing a family without a father present in the home. She becomes the feminine image for her children to view, as essential to boys in developing their manliness as to girls in developing their womanliness. She should also teach them about masculinity by providing them with a male image to associate with--her father, a brother, or another male person.<br><br>Within these pages you will learn principles to follow if you are to be happy, loved, and cherished. The study centers around the ideal woman, from a man's point of view, the kind of woman who awakens a man's deepest feelings of love. Within your reach is the possibility of a happy marriage. You can bring it about independent of any effort on the part of your husband. So, you hold the keys to your own happiness.<br><br>In accomplishing this you lose none of your dignity, influence, or freedom, but gain them, and it is only then that you can play your vital part in this world. The role of a woman when played correctly is fulfilling, fascinating, and full of intrigue. There never need be a dull moment. The practice of this art of womanhood is an enjoyable one, filled with rich rewards, numerous surprises, and vast happiness. Many years of experience teaching thousands of women has proven this to be true.</p><h2>Winter House</h2><p>Lavishly illustrated and endlessly inspiring, <i>Winter House</i> is the ultimate guide to creating a place&#x2014;and a frame of mind&#x2014;that will bring you joy throughout the years. <br><br>A winter house is a place to recharge your body and your spirit.

In <i>Write It Down, Make It Happen,</i> Henriette Anne Klauser, Ph.D., shows you how to write your own lifescript. Simply writing down your goals in life is the first step toward achieving them. </p><p> The "writing it down" part is not about time management; it's not a "to-do today" list that will make you feel guilty if you don't get every single thing done. Rather, writing it down is about clearing your head, identifying what you want, and setting your intent. You can "make it happen" purely by believing in the possibility. </p><p> There is no "right way" to write a goal down -- a single line jotted on a scrap of paper is as valuable as a full-blown description of the goal that goes on for several pages. Once you state your goals in writing, the rest of the world can cooperate with your ambition -- from grand career goals and major moves to having a better relationship with a teenage son, or simply waking up in the morning happy. </p><p> In <i>Write It Down, Make It Happen,</i> you will read stories from ordinary people who witnessed miracles large and small unfold in their lives after they performed the basic act of putting their goals on paper. Dr. Klauser also includes practical exercises and tips on how you can use writing to understand what you want and become a proactive force in your own destiny.</p></p><p><b>Henriette Anne Klauser, Ph.D.,</b> is the author of the popular books <i>Writing on Both Sides of the Brain</i> and <i>Put Your Heart on Paper.</i> As president of Writing Resources, Dr. Klauser gives presentations and leads work-shops on topics of goal setting, writing, and relationship building for national associations, government agencies, and universities, as well as several Fortune 500 companies. She is the mother of four children and lives in Edmonds, Washington.<b>Chapter Three: Gathering Ideas: A Suggestion Box for the Brain</b> <p>Once you start writing your goals down, the brain will send you all kinds of new material: innovative, energizing ideas for planning out and expanding those ambitions. That is the good news. Now for the bad: You will forget the best of the plans and ideas if you don't come up with a system for recording and reviewing them.</p> <p>Flash floods of insights come -- and go -- quickly.</p> <p>"The horror of that moment I shall never, never forget," says the king in <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i> The queen's quick retort: "You will though, if you don't make a memorandum of it."</p> <p>I recommend that you purchase and carry with you a small memo pad to gather your ideas immediately as they come to you. In many large companies, wall boxes inviting comments foster creative contributions by employees. Similarly, this tiny notebook in your pocket will become a kind of suggestion box for your brain, inviting ideas by the fact that you carry it on your person.</p> <p>One example of a small memo book that helps get the job done is a wheel book.</p> <p>"You can't build a house without a wheel book," is the expression my close friend Nancy used when she was constructing a residence in Texas from the ground up. </p> <p>"Wheel book" is a nautical term. Nancy's husband Eric is a retired navy captain; at one point they lived aboard a forty-one-foot sailing ship. The navy uses a large thread-bound green memo book to chart the activity at the helm (in the wheelhouse), and smaller versions to track jobs to be done around the ship. Every conscientious individual on the ship carries one, from captain to chief to seaman. A wheel book assures accurate accounting.</p> <p>The first contractor Nancy was working with in Texas constantly promised things on which he did not follow through, frustrating Nancy immensely -- until she hit upon the solution: he needed a wheel book to write things down.</p> <p>When Nancy gave the contractor a wheel book, his performance improved immediately. Since then, the motto "You can't build a house without a wheel book" has become for me a catch phrase to embody the necessity of capturing on paper the strategies surrounding any big task I am working on. Whenever I have a goal in motion, a dream under construction, I carry a wheel book devoted exclusively to that project. In fact, I often emblazon Nancy's credo across the front of a small book as I christen it for a new adventure. "You can't build a house without a wheel book" applies to constructing more than new residences.</p> <p>Although a wheel book keeps track, in one convenient place, of the people to call and jobs to get done, it is infinitely more than that. </p> <p>Having a place to record your musings, and keeping it and a pen nearby, sends a signal to the brain, "I am ready for your input."</p> <p>Carrying a little book with you honors the ideas that come to you, and when you do that, the part of your brain that comes up with these suggestions will be so thrilled to get a little attention and respect that it will send you even more. You will become a hotbed of lively suggestions sparking your imagination continually.</p> <p><b>Tidbit Journals</b></p> <p>A tidbit journal is another kind of collection box for ideas. In <i>Put Your Heart on Paper,</i> I describe how Sara Rashad used a tidbit journal while traveling, as a place to jot down images and phrases she saw and heard during the day. Later, at night, she would transfer those tidbits to her larger format journal, expanding the narrative. Sara said that carrying this little book with her was not just for remembering details, but made her pay attention in a sharper way to what was happening all around her. She said it put her "in tune with every moment."</p> <p>When I gave a two-week workshop in Skyros, Greece, to an international audience, I brought with me from the States tiny books, replicas of old-time school composition books with marbleized covers. Across the front of each little book I wrote each student's name and the word "tidbits."</p> <p>I told them to take the book wherever they went and jot down concepts as they came to their mind, perhaps images they might want to write up more thoroughly later, or plans to put in motion once they returned to their own countries.</p> <p>By the second day, they told me warmly that having a place to record their impressions was keeping all their senses alert. It was helping them notice more, be more aware. It was encouraging them to think.</p> <p>I still chuckle when I remember how I'd see my students everywhere on the island, making "tidbit" entries -- on the beach, at the taverna, at the folk museum. One night we all went dancing at a nightclub on the edge of the Aegean called Skyropoula. There was Briano, a member of the class, in the midst of all the merriment, sitting in a corner with a glass of retsina, as eager as a cub reporter, capturing his fleeting thoughts on paper. What a happy look he had on his face.</p> <p>By the end of our two-week session together, they knew this wasn't just something to do for a summer course, but for the rest of their lives. They were astonished at how carrying those little books in their pockets had changed their entire experience of being in Greece. </p> <p>"I found myself," said Nonnie from Surrey, with delight, "as living twice as much as I did before, because I was paying attention more."</p> <p>That's because carrying a tidbit journal makes you keener to the workings of the RAS (reticular activating system) we talked about in chapter 1. Having a wheel book or a tidbit book ready at hand stimulates your thalamus to alert the cortex: Wake up. Open your eyes. Look and see. Be present to the signs all around you. Life is on your side.</p> <p>And keeping track of these signs by noting them makes them mount up.</p> <p><b>Changing the Conversation</b></p> <p>The "suggestion box for the brain" does not have to be a spiral or a sewn, bound book. It is just as effective -- for some, more so -- when the "ahas" you experience are captured and corralled on loose index cards.</p> <p>During a recent business trip to Manhattan, I had the opportunity to visit with John Sexton, the energetic and charismatic dean of New York University Law School, and my former high school debate coach.</p> <p>I had read an article about John Sexton in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> that mentioned his peripatetic habit of noting on the go, and was curious to learn more about it. He was happy to tell me about the "Sextonian suggestion box," which is both portable and potent.</p> <p>The dean carries a stack of unlined, white, jumbo index cards in his breast pocket. He pulls out one card at a time to make a note as something occurs to him, recording only one comment per card, with the card held vertically.</p> <p>Once he has written something down in black ink on the white card, he is free to move on to other considerations. It is, as he himself likes to say, "a done deal."</p> <p>He writes on the cards anything that he doesn't want to forget, either personal or professional.</p> <p>"If I am not thinking about family, I am thinking about school; something will come into my memory bank. Or maybe I'm trolling to see if there is anything that I ought to be doing, or I ought to have done, at home, or to set something up at school."</p> <p>Before it escapes him, he jots it down.</p> <p>The dean says he gets his ideas while walking through Washington Square Park, or when he's in a car going to an appointment. Sometimes an idea hits him in the middle of the night, or while shaving.</p> <p>"It might be a thought about a major new direction for the school; something unusual, an inspiration."</p> <p>Wherever he is, a card is nearby. He grabs one and writes down the elusive thought.</p> <p>"Or perhaps, an idea is developing, and in conversation I'll get a 'cut' on it I hadn't thought of before. Sometimes those ideas survive discussions with a colleague, and sometimes they don't, so what I will do then is write the idea on a card to make sure it survives."</p> <p>Sexton throws out the cards that have to do with appointments, or "if it's just an information thing"; others he gives to the appropriate faculty member or keeps on file until the job is done.</p> <p>For John Sexton, however, his system of index cards is dramatically more important than a running "to-do" list, easily dispersed and delegated.</p> <p>They are integral to his whole style of leadership. The dean has profound philosophical reflections on the part they play in his vision of community leadership at a great university and the whole notion of a leader. He calls it his "aspirational mode."</p> <p>"We have always understood culturally at some level the power of the word and the role of a leader to see things better than they are. Making it concrete actuates it. If you articulate something that is within the community's reach but not yet actuated, the articulation of the goal can move the community toward that actuation.

Ever since, he's been fighting a bad back, fighting the bottle, fighting his conscience. But now he's in for a special fight. Never before has he come up against anyone like Tess Binder. She's a stunningly beautiful, sexually spirited three-time divorcee from Newport Beach--capital of California's Golden Orange, where wallets are fat, bikinis are skimpy, and cosmetic surgery is one sure way to a billionaire's bank account. Nearly a year ago Tess Binder's father washed up on the beach with a bullet in his ear. The coroner called it suicide, but to Tess it means the fear of her own fate. And Winnie Farlowe is a man willing to follow wherever she leads--straight into the juicy pulp of the Golden Orange, a world where money is everything, but nothing adds up . . . where death and chicanery flourish amidst ranches, mansions, and yachting parties.

Safe behind the walls of anonymity, hundreds of real women responded to Nancy Friday's call for details of their own most private fantasies. <i>My Secret Garden</i> is the daring compilation of those fantasies. When it first appeared, it created a storm of outrage in the media...and an equal sense of exhilaration for those women who finally were able to share their sisters' most intimate thoughts. Even now, in a new millennium, over then thousand women each year buy a new copy of this astounding classic of feminist literature. Join them in their exploration of the meaning of desire. Dare to read, dare to dream, and dare to discover the beautiful blossoms, the winding paths, and the hidden nooks of female sexuality.</p><p>This book caused quite a ruckus when it was released 25 years ago because it directly quotes the sexual fantasies of dozens of women, ranging from the "very common" rape fantasy to lesbian affairs to unusually explicit scenarios that are unmentionable here. While author Nancy Friday maintains that <i>My Secret Garden</i> served to free millions of women from sexual oppression, there's still a need today to get rid of the guilt that millions more still feel when it comes to fantasizing, having orgasms, and making one's sexual wishes be known. "How could it be, you might ask," she writes, "that women today, at the turn of the century, would still think they were the only Bad Girls with erotic thoughts? What kind of prison is this that that women impose on themselves?" <p> <i>My Secret Garden</i> has the prurient appeal that made it one of the most passed-around books in high school study halls (it boasts chapters titled "Insatiability" and "The Thrill of the Forbidden"), but its premise, underneath the tales of lusty longings, is a serious one. Friday, also author of <i>My Mother, My Self</i> and <i>Women on Top</i>, is appalled at how parents, especially mothers, instill in their children a deep fear of sexual pleasure, and she advises how to do away with this stultifying force. While Friday can get a little histrionic at times ("Women's lust ... could bring down not only individuals, but society itself"), that doesn't make this book any less enthralling. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p><b>Nancy Friday</b> is the bestselling author of <i>My Secret Garden, Jealousy, Men in Love, My Mother/My Self, Women on Top, The Power of Beauty</i> and, most recently, <i>Our Looks, Our Lives.</i> She lives in Key West, Florida, and in Connecticut.</p><h2>The Tyranny of Metrics</h2><p><p><b>How the obsession with quantifying human performance threatens business, medicine, education, government&#x2015;and the quality of our lives</b></p><p>Today, organizations of all kinds are ruled by the belief that the path to success is quantifying human performance, publicizing the results, and dividing up the rewards based on the numbers. But in our zeal to instill the evaluation process with scientific rigor, we've gone from measuring performance to fixating on measuring itself&#x2015;and this tyranny of metrics now threatens the quality of our organizations and lives. In this brief, accessible, and powerful book, Jerry Muller uncovers the damage metrics are causing and shows how we can begin to fix the problem. Filled with examples from business, medicine, education, government, and other fields, the book explains why paying for measured performance doesn't work, why surgical scorecards may increase deaths, and much more. But Muller also shows that, when used as a complement to judgment based on personal experience, metrics can be beneficial, and he includes an invaluable checklist of when and how to use them. The result is an essential corrective to a harmful trend that increasingly affects us all.</p></p><p>How our obsession with quantifying human performance threatens our schools, medical care, businesses, and government<p> "In this clear and compelling book, Jerry Muller shows how our attempts to improve organizational outcomes through quantitative measures have metastasized into a culture of gaming and manipulation. Through carefully researched case studies on education, healthcare, and compensation, <i>The Tyranny of Metrics</i> makes a convincing case that we need to restore judgment and ethical considerations at a time when shallow quantification threatens the integrity of our most important institutions."<b>--Rakesh Khurana, Harvard Business School</b></p><p> "Have you ever wondered why universities make the mistake of hiring presidents with little or no experience in higher education, or why, nine times out of ten, these foreign imports fail? Then read Jerry Muller's new book and you will understand such folly as one more instance of an unhappy, massive trend--abandoning the situated judgment of experienced professionals in favor of the supposedly objective judgment promised (but not delivered) by the magic bullet of metrics: standardized measures and huge data banks touted as generating insight and wisdom all by themselves. Muller dismantles this myth in a brisk and no-nonsense prose that has this reader crying 'yes, yes' at every sentence."<b>--Stanley Fish, author of <i>Winning Arguments</i> and <i>Think Again</i></b></p><p> "Quantification, once only a tool, has become a cult. I can think of no better deprogrammer than Jerry Muller, whose renowned skills in dissecting political and social doctrines are evident here. <i>The Tyranny of Metrics </i>should be essential reading for managers and the managed alike."<b>--Edward Tenner, author of <i>The Efficiency Paradox: What Big Data Can't Do</i> and <i>Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences</i></b></p><p> "In <i>The Tyranny of Metrics</i>, Jerry Muller has brought to life the many ways in which numerical evaluations result in deleterious performance: in our schools, our universities, our hospitals, our military, and our businesses. This book addresses a major problem."<b>--George A. Akerlof, Nobel Prize-winning economist</b></p><p> "<i>The Tyranny of Metrics</i> is an important and accessible book about a growing problem. It comes as close as anything I've read to showing us how to break out of the dysfunctional cycle of measuring, finding out that measuring doesn't get us where we want to go, but then measuring some more."<b>--David Chinitz, School of Public Health, Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School</b></p><p> "Broad in scope and ambition, persuasively argued, and engagingly written, <i>The Tyranny of Metrics</i> is a very compelling book."<b>--Mark Schlesinger, Yale University</b></p></p><h2>Planting Gardens in Graves</h2><p><b>From the beloved author of <i>Whiskey, Words, and a Shovel</i> comes the first volume in an all new series.</b><br><br>r.h.

But what seems a simple case at the outset soon becomes increasingly complicated when three of the heiress&#x2019;s old friends are found dead. Is there a connection between the woman&#x2019;s mysterious disappearance and the murders? Who would want to kill three seemingly respectable young women? As Maisie investigates, she discovers that the answers lie in the unforgettable agony of the Great War.</p><p>Jacqueline Winspear is the author of <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Maisie Dobbs series, as well as <i>The Care and Management of Lies</i>, a novel of World War I. Originally from Kent, England, she now lives in California.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>Maisie Dobbs shuffled the papers on her desk into a neat pile and placed them in a plain manila folder. She took up green marble-patterned W.H. Smith fountain pen and inscribed the cover with the name of her new clients: Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Johnson, who were concerned that their son&#x2019;s fianc�e might have misled them regarding her past. It was the sort of case that was easily attended to, that would provide a useful reference, and that could be closed with presentation of a timely report and accompanying account for her services. But for Maisie the case notes would not be filed away until those whose lives were touched by her investigation had reached a certain peace with her findings, with themselves, and with one another&#x2014;as far as that might be possible. As she wrote, a tendril of jet black hair tumbled down into her eyes. Sighing, she quickly pushed it back into the chignon at the nape of her neck. Suddenly, Maisie set her pen on the blotting pad, pulled the troublesome wisp of hair free so that it hung down again, and walked to the large mirror hanging on the wall above the fireplace. She unpinned her long hair and tucked it inside the collar of her white silk blouse, pulling out just an inch or so around her chin-line. Would shorter hair suit her?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Perhaps Lady Rowan is right,&#x201d; said Maisie to her reflection in the mirror. &#x201c;Perhaps it <i>would</i> look better in a bob.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned from side to side several times, and lifted her hair just slightly. Shorter hair might save a few minutes of precious time each morning, and it would no longer come free of the chignon and fall into her eyes. But one thing held her back. She lifted her hair and turned her head. Was the scar visible? Would shorter hair fall in such a way as to reveal the purple weal that etched a line from her neck into the sensitive flesh of her scalp? If her hair were cut, would she lean forward over her notes one day and unwittingly allow a client to see the damage inflicted by the German shell that had ripped into the casualty clearing station where she was working, in France, in 1917?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the room reflected in the mirror, Maisie considered how far she had come&#x2014;not only from the dark dingy office in Warren Street that was all she had been able to afford just over a year ago, but from that first meeting with Maurice Blanche, her mentor and teacher, when she had been a maid in the household of Lord Julian Compton and his wife, Lady Rowan. It was Maurice and Lady Rowan who had noted Maisie&#x2019;s intellect and ensured that she had every opportunity to pursue her hunger for education. They had made it possible for the former tweeny maid to gain admission to Girton College, Cambridge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maisie quickly pulled her hair into a neat chignon again, and as she pinned the twist into place, she glanced out of the floor-to-ceiling window that overlooked Fitzroy Square. Her assistant, Billy Beale, had just turned in to the square and was crossing the rain-damp gray flagstones toward the office. Her scar began to throb. As she watched Billy, Maisie began to assume his posture. She moved toward the window with shoulders dropped, hands thrust into imaginary pockets, and her gait mimicking the awkwardness caused by Billy&#x2019;s still-troublesome war wounds. Her disposition began to change, and she realized that the occasional malaise she had sensed several weeks ago was now a constant in Billy&#x2019;s life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she looked down at him from what had once been the drawing room window of the Georgian building, he stretched the cuff of his overcoat over the palm of his hand and polished the brass nameplate informing visitors that the office of M. Dobbs, Psychologist and Investigator, was situated within. Satisfied, Billy straightened, drew back his shoulders, stretched his spine, ran his fingers through his tousled shock of wheaten hair, and took out his key to the main door. Maisie watched as he corrected his posture. <i>You can&#x2019;t fool me, Billy Beale,</i> she said to herself. The front door closed with a heavy thud, and the stairs creaked as Billy ascended to the office.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Morning, Miss. I picked up the records you wanted.&#x201d; Billy placed a plain brown envelope on Maisie&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;Oh, and another thing, Miss, I bought a <i>Daily Express</i> for you to &#x2019;ave a butcher&#x2019;s &#x2019;ook at.&#x201d; He took a newspaper from the inside pocket of his overcoat. &#x201c;That woman what was found murdered in &#x2019;er own &#x2019;ome a week or two ago down in Surrey&#x2014;you remember, in Coulsden&#x2014;well, there&#x2019;s more details &#x2019;ere, of who she was, and the state she was in when she was found.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thank you, Billy,&#x201d; said Maisie, taking the newspaper.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She was only your age, Miss. Terrible, innit?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It certainly is.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I wonder if our friend . . . well, your friend, really&#x2014;Detective Inspector Stratton&#x2014;is involved?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Most likely. Since the murder took place outside London, it&#x2019;s a Murder Squad case.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy looked thoughtful. &#x201c;Fancy &#x2019;avin&#x2019; to say you work for the Murder Squad, eh, Miss? Don&#x2019;t exactly warm folk to you, does it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maisie scanned the article quickly. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s a newspaper invention to sell more papers. I think they started to use it when the Crippen case became big news. It used to be called the Reserve Squad, but that didn&#x2019;t sound ominous enough. And Criminal Investigation Department is a bit of a mouthful.&#x201d; Maisie looked up at Billy, &#x201c;And by the way, Billy, what do you mean by my &#x2018;friend,&#x2019; eh?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Aw, nuffin&#x2019; really, Miss. It&#x2019;s just that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy was interrupted by the ringing of the black telephone on Maisie&#x2019;s desk. He raised his eyebrows and reached for the receiver.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fitzroy five six double 0. Good afternoon, Detective Inspector Stratton. Yes, she&#x2019;s &#x2019;ere. I&#x2019;ll put her on.&#x201d; He smiled broadly, covering the receiver with his palm as Maisie, blushing slightly, held out her hand to take it. &#x201c;Now, Miss, what was it that Doctor Blanche used to say about coincidence being a&#x2014;what was it? Oh yes, a messenger of truth?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough, Billy.&#x201d; Maisie took the receiver and waved him away. &#x201c;Inspector Stratton, how very nice to hear from you. I expect you&#x2019;re busy with the murder case in Coulsden.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And how did you know that, Miss Dobbs? No, don&#x2019;t tell me. It&#x2019;s probably best that I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maisie laughed. &#x201c;To what do I owe this call, Inspector?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Purely social, Miss Dobbs. I thought I&#x2019;d ask if you might care to dine with me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maisie hesitated, tapped the desk with her pen, and then replied,<br>&#x201c;Thank you for the invitation, Inspector Stratton. It really is most kind<br>of you . . . but perhaps we can lunch together instead.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a pause. &#x201c;Certainly, Miss Dobbs. Will you be free on Friday?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, Friday would be excellent.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Good. I&#x2019;ll meet you at your office at noon, and we can go from there to Bertorelli&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maisie hesitated. &#x201c;May I meet you at Bertorelli&#x2019;s? At noon?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again the line was quiet. Why does this have to be so difficult? Maisie thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course. Friday, noon at Bertorelli&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you then. Good-bye.&#x201d; She replaced the receiver thoughtfully.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Aye-oop, &#x2019;ere&#x2019;s a nice cuppa for you, Miss.&#x201d; Billy placed the tea tray on his desk, poured milk and tea into a large enamel mug for Maisie, and placed it in front of her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind me askin&#x2019;, Miss&#x2014;and I know it ain&#x2019;t none of my business, like&#x2014;but why don&#x2019;t you take &#x2019;im up on the offer of a dinner? I mean, gettin&#x2019; the odd dinner fer nuffin&#x2019; ain&#x2019;t such a bad thing.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Lunch and dinner are two entirely different things, and going out for luncheon with a gentleman is definitely not the same as going out to dine in the evening.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You get more grub at dinner, for a start&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Billy was interrupted by the doorbell. As he moved to the window<br>to see who might be calling, Maisie noticed him rub his thigh and<br>wince. The war wound, suffered almost thirteen years before, during<br>the Battle of Messines in 1917, was nipping at him again. Billy left to<br>answer the doorbell, and as he did so, Maisie heard him negotiate the<br>stairs with difficulty as he descended to the front door.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Message for M. Dobbs. Urgent. Sign &#x2019;ere, please.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thanks, mate.&#x201d; As Billy signed for the envelope he reached into his pocket for some change to hand the messenger. He closed the door and sighed before mounting the stairs again. As he returned to the office he held out the envelope to Maisie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That leg giving you trouble?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Just a bit more than usual. Mind you, I&#x2019;m not as young as I was.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Have you been back to the doctor?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not lately. There ain&#x2019;t much they can do, is there? I&#x2019;m a lucky fella&#x2014;got a nice job when there&#x2019;s &#x2019;undreds and &#x2019;undreds of blokes linin&#x2019;<br>up fer work. Can&#x2019;t be feelin&#x2019; sorry for meself, can I?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re fortunate, Billy. There seems to be more business for us, what with people going missing after losing all their money, and others getting up to no good at all.&#x201d; She turned the envelope in her hands. &#x201c;Well, well, well . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What is it, Miss?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you notice the return address on the envelope? This letter&#x2019;s from Joseph Waite.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You mean <i>the</i> Joseph Waite? Moneybags Joseph Waite? The one they call the Banker&#x2019;s Butcher?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;s requested that I come to his residence&#x2014;&#x2018;soonest,&#x2019; he says&#x2014;to receive instructions for an investigation.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I suppose &#x2019;e&#x2019;s used to orderin&#x2019; folk around and getting &#x2019;is own way&#x2014;&#x201d; Billy was interrupted once more by the ringing telephone. &#x201c;Gawd, Miss, there goes the&nbsp; dog-and-bone again!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maisie reached for the receiver.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fitzroy five six double 0.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;May I speak to Miss Maisie Dobbs, please?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Speaking. How may I help you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This is Miss Arthur, secretary to Joseph Waite. Mr. Waite is expecting you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Good morning, Miss Arthur. I have only just received his letter via personal messenger.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Good. Can you come today at three? Mr. Waite will see you then, for half an hour.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman&#x2019;s voice trembled slightly. Was Miss Arthur so much in awe of her employer?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Right you are, Miss Arthur. My assistant and I will arrive at three. Now, may I have directions?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, the address is as follows: Do you know Dulwich?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ready when you are, Miss.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maisie looked at the silver nurse&#x2019;s watch pinned to her jacket as if it were a brooch. The watch had been a gift from Lady Rowan when Maisie took leave from Girton College and became a VAD at the London Hospital, a member of the wartime Voluntary Aid Detachment of nursing staff during the Great War. It had kept perfect time since the very first moment she pinned it to her uniform, serving her well while she tended injured men at a casualty clearing station in France, and again when she nursed shell-shocked patients upon her return. And since completing her studies at Girton the watch had been synchronized many times with the pocket watch belonging to Maurice Blanche, when she worked as his assistant. It would serve her for a few more years yet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Just time to complete one more small task, Billy; then we&#x2019;ll be on our way. It&#x2019;s the first week of the month, and I have some accounts to do.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maisie took a key from her purse, opened the middle drawer on the right-hand side of her large desk, and selected one small ledger from the six bound notebooks in the drawer. The ledger was labeled motor car.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maisie had been given use of the smart MG 14/40 sports roadster belonging to Lady Rowan the year before. Recurring hip pain suffered as the result of a hunting accident rendered driving difficult for Lady Rowan, and she insisted that Maisie borrow the motor car whenever she wanted. After using the vehicle constantly for some months, Maisie had offered to purchase the MG. Lady Rowan teased that it must have been the only transaction involving a motor car in which the buyer insisted upon paying more than the owner had stipulated. A small percentage for interest had been added at Maisie&#x2019;s insistence. Taking up her pen, Maisie pulled her checkbook from the same drawer and wrote a check, payable to Lady Rowan Compton. The amount paid was entered in a ledger column and the new balance owed underlined in red.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Right then, Billy, just about done. All secure?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, Miss. Case maps are in my desk, and locked. Card file is locked. Tea is locked&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Billy!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Just pullin&#x2019; yer leg, Miss!&#x201d; Billy opened the door for Maisie, and they left the office, making sure that the door was locked behind them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maisie looked up at the leaden sky. &#x201c;Looks like rain again, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It does at that. Better get on our way and &#x2019;ope it blows over.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The motor car was parked at the edge of Fitzroy Street, its shining paintwork a splash of claret against the gray April afternoon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy held the door for her, then lifted the bonnet to turn on the fuel pump, closing it again with a clatter that made Maisie wince. As he leaned over the engine, Maisie observed the gray smudges below his eyes. Banter was Billy&#x2019;s way of denying pain. He gave the thumbs-up sign, and Maisie set the ignition, throttle, and choke before pressing the starter button on the floor of the motor car. The engine burst into life. He opened the passenger door and took his seat beside her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Off we go, then. Sure of your way?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, I know Dulwich. The journey shouldn&#x2019;t take more than an hour, depending upon the traffic.&#x201d; Maisie slipped the MG into gear and eased out into Warren Street.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just go over what we already know about Waite. That Maurice had file cards on him is intriguing in itself.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, according to this first card, Dr. Blanche went to &#x2019;im askin&#x2019; for money for a clinic. What&#x2019;s that about?&#x201d; Billy glanced at Maisie, then looked ahead at the road. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s starting to come down.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I know. London weather, so fabulously predictable you never know what might happen,&#x201d; observed Maisie before answering Billy&#x2019;s question. &#x201c;Maurice was a doctor, Billy; you know that. Before he specialized in medical jurisprudence, his patients had a bit more life in them.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I should &#x2019;ope so.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Anyway, years ago, long before I went to work at Ebury Place, Maurice was involved in a case that took him to the ...</p><h2>Who Was Abigail Adams?</h2><p>Abigail Adams was a strong woman far ahead of her time.

Then things got weird when the hot dog bit Wendell, and weirder still when Wendell started to sprout back hair. Could Wendell be morphing into a . . . (<i>cue ominous music</i>) were-wiener? All evidence points to yes. And unless he and Danny can get past the lunch ladies and slay the alpha-wurst, the whole school could be infected.<p>Written in Ursula Vernon's trademark hybrid style of comic-book panels and text, this is the thrilling third book in the series. In a starred review, Kirkus Reviews said <i>Dragonbreath</i> "will leave readers in stiches- and on tenterhooks waiting for the next one."

In Lawrence&#x2019;s case, he would have to complete those distances and then make it to the next state in time to do it all over again the next day. Even Lawrence&#x2019;s coach didn&#x2019;t think he could do it; he penciled in another event the day Lawrence was supposed to complete the challenge. But with the support of Sunny and their five children in tow, and with grassroots support conjured always at the last minute via Facebook, Lawrence accomplished exactly what he set out to do. Iron Cowboy is the story of Lawrence&#x2019;s herculean 50-day journey and all the wonderful, miserable, and life-threatening events that happened along the way, as well as a glance at his life leading up to the mission, and winning two prior world records. Lawrence holds two world records in the Guinness Book of World Records: one for completing 22 half-Ironmans in one year (2010) and one for completing 30 full Ironmans in one year (2012). In 2015, he set a record for completing 50 Ironman distances in 50 states in 50 days. Through social media and press, Lawrence was able to find fans in each state&#x2014;anywhere from 3 to 500 people&#x2014;to complete some of the Ironman alongside him, and supporters were invited to join him for the Iron Cowboy 5k (the last 3.1 miles of James&#x2019;s marathon); for his last Ironman in his home state of Utah, more than 3,500 people showed up. Along the way, Lawrence survived tropical storms, internal bleeding, hypothermia, hyperthermia, dehydration, nerve damage, infected foot blisters, a blood-clot scare, extreme sleep deprivation (he only got four to five hours of sleep each night), and a bike crash!</p><p>The Iron Cowboy: Guinness World Record Holder, endurance athlete, entrepreneur, &amp; renowned speaker. 50 Full Distances Triathlon in 50 Days in 50 States James lives with his wife, Sunny, and their five children in Utah.

Single dimension, cartooned images with bold colors feature the mouse&#x2014;"He won't hear a word you say," "won't have the slightest idea what's happening"&#x2014;as he walks along, oblivious to surroundings or life-threatening dangers. Falling from a roller coaster, freeing all creatures at a wild animal amusement park, falling from a cliff into the ocean, or riding a dolphin to a remote island, Applesauce remains absorbed with the phone and tap-tapping away, ignoring his friend until the battery...runs...out. Speech bubbles continue a mostly one-sided conversation between the mouse and his remarkably calm friend. References to Minecraft, screen time, outlets, and chargers might take the vocabulary above its intended audience, but the dangers of Applesauce's tech-obsession are visually clear.

Most dwarves are born deep underground, at least a mile below The Surface, preferably in a cavern filled with crystals and gems: diamonds for strength, emeralds for wisdom, and sapphires for truth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mothers and fathers try to feed their dwarflings as many healthy powerful gems as they can within a few hours of birth, to give them the best chance in life. But I was fed none.<br> &nbsp;<br> My parents had been traveling downward the day I was born. Mother could feel me turning hard inside her belly, a sign that the time was drawing near. She wanted the very best for me. She wanted to be as deep in the earth as possible, in the birthing caverns, with their rich deposits of nutritious crystals and gems. But as my parents traveled downward, before they had even descended below the main cavern, there was a sudden collapse in one of the tunnels. The rocks nearly crushed my mother, and me with her. My father was able to get us out of the way just in time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, the collapse had blocked the tunnel, so we had to go up to find another way down. The strain of the climb was too much for my poor mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rubald!&#x201d; she cried, clutching her belly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And there was no time to waste. A dwarfling can stay inside its mother&#x2019;s belly for a solid decade or more, but when we&#x2019;re ready to come out, we come fast.<br> &nbsp;<br> And so I was born in a cavern mere feet below the earth&#x2019;s surface, where roots dangled from the ceiling, water trickled down the walls, and the only available food was a salty gruel called strolg, made out of common rocks and minerals. Mother was devastated.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My poor little dwarfling!&#x201d; she cooed as she spooned the strolg into my mouth, then fed me a few pebbles to satisfy my need to bite and crunch. &#x201c;What kind of life will he have, Rubald?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A fine life, Rumelda,&#x201d; said my father, ever the optimist. &#x201c;A happy life.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And what will we call him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My parents both looked at their surroundings. Dwarves are usually named with some regard to the gems and crystals within the cavern in which they are born, but there were no diamonds or sapphires in that cavern. Not even quartz or marble. Just plain rocks and roots.<br> &nbsp;<br> Father brushed his hands over the rough walls, studying the layers of dirt and minerals. &#x201c;Borlen,&#x201d; he said with wonder.<br> &nbsp;<br> Borlen was a mineral found only near The Surface. It was not so common in our colony but useful when it could be found. It was too bitter to eat, but potters liked it because it made their clay more malleable without weakening it. Borlen could also serve as a warning. A mining crew knew by the sight of it that they were digging dangerously close to The Surface. Most dwarves would rather not find any.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll call him Borlen,&#x201d; said Father.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think that name will make him seem a bit . . . odd?&#x201d; Mother asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s special,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be one of a kind, our dwarfling. We&#x2019;ll get him deep into the earth as soon as possible and feed him all the best crystals and gems. But wait!&#x201d; My father pulled something from his pocket and held it out to my mother. &#x201c;I almost forgot. I&#x2019;ve been saving this from the moment I knew we had a dwarfling on the way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mother gasped. &#x201c;A ruby!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rubies were rare and particularly powerful gems. They could ward off evil, enhance powers, and even lengthen lives. Emegert of Tunnel 588 was said to have found a large deposit of rubies, and he lived for ten thousand years. Two thousand years was considered a good long life for a dwarf.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mother took the ruby from my father and dropped it onto my tongue. I crunched on the gem, gave a little belch, and fell asleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> The very next day, my parents tried to move me to deeper caverns, but as soon as they started to carry me downward, I began to cry. The deeper we went, the louder I wailed, until my eyes leaked tears of dust, a sign of deep distress and discomfort from any dwarf.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; said Mother. &#x201c;Rubald, I think our dwarfling is afraid of depths!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nonsense,&#x201d; said Father. &#x201c;He only needs to adjust.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But I did not adjust. I cried for hours on end. My parents tried everything to console me. They fed me amber, amethyst, and blue-laced agate. They bathed me in crushed rose quartz and hung peridot above my cradle, all to no avail. And so, distraught from my endless wails, and desperate to try anything, my parents took me back to the cavern near The Surface where I was born.<br> &nbsp;<br> I stopped crying.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; said Mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How odd,&#x201d; said Father.<br> &nbsp;<br> And after that, my parents were obliged to make my unfortunate birthing cavern our home, hoping my fear of depths would subside eventually. But it didn&#x2019;t. It only got worse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> For years, my parents worked to get me used to depths. Father tried to lead me a little deeper each day, luring me with my favorite gems and the different sights and wonders of the colony--the lava rivers, the blue springs, the dragon hatchery, the potters and glassblowers and goldsmiths. But no matter how interesting the surroundings, no matter how many sapphires and rubies he offered, my depth symptoms would always overpower me. I&#x2019;d start to get dizzy, then I&#x2019;d feel like I was shrinking and shriveling, and we&#x2019;d have to go back home.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was shameful enough that I was afraid of depths, but that wasn&#x2019;t the worst of it. As much as I hated going downward, I was equally drawn to going upward. My first word was &#x201c;up,&#x201d; much to my parents&#x2019; chagrin, and as soon as I understood that there was an actual world above us, I wanted to know everything about it. I pestered my parents with questions. What did The Surface look like? How was it different from our caves? Did any dwarves live up there? Why didn&#x2019;t we live up there? Could we go there?<br> &nbsp;<br> My parents knew next to nothing about The Surface. Neither of them had seen it, nor did they have any desire to. Mother usually sidestepped my questions or changed the subject, but Father indulged my curiosity. He took me to the colony&#x2019;s records room--a vast cavern filled with many millennia of our history and collective knowledge engraved on stone tablets and slates. Normally, I wouldn&#x2019;t have tolerated the depths of the cavern, but my thirst for information overcame my fear. I scoured the records for any facts I could find about The Surface. I learned it was a big, open place with an endless blue ceiling called the sky, and a big golden ball suspended in the sky called the sun. There were things that grew on The Surface that didn&#x2019;t grow underground. Things called trees and flowers and bushes. There were strange beasts that roamed The Surface--horses, bears, and wolves. But the most fascinating of all were the humans.<br><br></p></p><h2>Lonely Planet Costa Rican Spanish Phrasebook &amp; Dictionary 5</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's #1 phrasebook publisher*</i> </p><p><b>Lonely Planet's </b><b>Costa Rican Spanish </b><b>Phrasebook &amp; Dictionary </b>is your handy passport to culturally enriching travels with the most relevant and useful Costa Rican Spanish phrases and vocabulary for all your travel needs.

Executions of suspected witches were intermittent, and various explanations of behaviors deemed suspect were thought to be caused by possession, either by the devil or demon such as an incubus or succubus. <br><br> Kramer wrote this book after he had tried and failed to have a woman executed for witchcraft. Unhappy at the verdict of the court, he authored the Malleus Maleficarum as a manual for other witch seekers to refer to. For centuries the text was used by Christians as a reference source on matters of demonology, although it was not used directly by the Inquisition who became notorious for their tortures and murders. <br><br> Contrary to popular supposition, Kramer's work does not exclusively recommend death by burning as a punishment for witches. It also describes various methods of exorcism, whereby the demonic force may be banished from the body of the suffering witch. However the book openly advocates discrimination against women, albeit while acknowledging that a minority of witchcraft practitioners are male. <br><br> A theory on why the vast majority of witches are female is posited, rooted in the presence of woman in the Biblical canon; as with Eve, the wife of Adam, and Mary; the mother of Jesus Christ. By the end of the book, it is agreed that witches are created from a pact made with the Devil himself, with whom they engage in sexual liaisons. The witch is then summoned by flight to an evil assembly headed by the Devil, encouraged to practice illicit forms of sex, and then granted the powers of maleficent magic. <br><br> Decades after the initial publication, the name of James Sprenger was credited. Scholars disagree on whether he was a meaningful contributor who expanded the core text. Whatever the case may be, for its thoroughness the Malleus Maleficarum is the single most complete source on Christian attitudes to witchcraft and demons in existence. <br><br> This translation to English by Montague Summers underwent revision and refinement over the years. This edition contains the original introductions, wherein the translator explains the process by which he strove for the greatest accuracy possible.</p><p></p><h2>Victory Decrees: Daily Prophetic Strategies for Spiritual Warfare Victory</h2><p><b>Declarations and decrees that give you an advantage over the enemy!</b><p>The enemy of every believer prowls around like a roaring lion, searching for lives to devour.

We've been operating with a model that says in order to have healthy relationships, we need to focus on meeting other people&#x2019;s needs, trying to serve them and make them happy. To even question such a model draws controversy, I know, but stay with me.<br><b>By focusing on yourself, you will have a healthier, happier relationship with your whole family.</b><br>This book is going to talk about why this model is so faulty, particularly in our parent&#x2013;child relationships. For now, there are a few simple things we should consider. First, it's a given that there are things in this world we can control and things we cannot control. Now ask yourself this question: How smart is it to focus your energy on something you can't do anything about, something you cannot control? Answer: Not very. Follow&#x2013;up question: Which category do your kids fall into? In other words, are your children something you can control or something you cannot control? Here&#x2019;s an even tougher question: Even if you could control your kids, should you? Is that what parenting is all about? And what if it&#x2019;s not the kids who are out of control?<br><b>Who</b>&#x2019;<b>s Really Out of Control Here?<br></b><br>My kids, Hannah and Brandon, were four and two, and it was one of <i>those</i> Saturday mornings. My wife, Jenny, and I had stayed up way too late on Friday night, which guaranteed that our kids would get up way too early the next day. And so the weekend began with a lot of whining and crying and complaining&#x2014;and the kids were upset as well.<br><br>So I decided, in my parenting expert wisdom, to get us all out of the house. Let&#x2019;s go to Waffle House for breakfast. Now the first Waffle House we walked into was just too full, but, thankfully, there is no shortage of Waffle Houses in suburban Atlanta. So, we piled back into the car, strapped our children into their car seats, quieted disappointed whines with promises of lots of maple syrup, and drove the hundred yards or so to a second Waffle House. And the line at the second one was just as long as the first.<br><br>There was no way we were getting the kids back into the car for another trip, however, so we decided to wait it out. Thankfully, the staff at this Waffle House were thinking&#x2014;they had crayons and blank paper for the kids. My wife and I could even get in a little adult conversation. A win-win situation.<br><br>As if that weren't enough, a sign caught my eye. If my children drew a picture, they were entitled to a paper Waffle House hat&#x2014;just like the grill man wears&#x2014;and a free waffle. Sometimes life is good. The kids colored. My wife and I talked. The time flew and before we knew it, we were seated&#x2014;my wife and daughter on one side of the booth, my son and I on the other. They brought the kids their paper hats, and I even tried one on.<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve never been to a Waffle House, you would be amazed at the consistency of their architecture. All the tables surround the kitchen, and wall-length windows surround the tables. It&#x2019;s very open, and it&#x2019;s easy to notice the goings-on of others.<br><br>Now, while I was feeling pretty good by this time, my kids hadn&#x2019;t eaten anything all morning. Hungry kids who&#x2019;ve done nothing but wait around can be...restless. Hannah, our four&#x2013;year&#x2013;old, handled it all right, just garden&#x2013;variety complaints. But Brandon, our two&#x2013;year&#x2013;old, sure was feeling two years old, if you know what I mean. Two&#x2013;year-olds generally have no regard for things like &#x201c;practicing an inside voice&#x201d; or &#x201c;using words like a big boy&#x201d; when they&#x2019;ve been forced in and out of a car with nothing to eat but promises. Cooperating with me was not high on his list of priorities at the time. Enjoying a nice family breakfast didn't seem like such a good idea now.<br><br>But I'm a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist. I&#x2019;m a relationship coach. I know how to control myself and keep from losing my temper. I know better than to react and resort to yelling and violent acts of coercion. I can stay calm in the face of increasing levels of anxiety. But then my son threw his fork on the floor. My resolve began to fade.<br><br>The fork made a loud noise, causing all the people around us to look at me. Some of them even pointed and whispered (at least that&#x2019;s what it felt like they were doing). I looked over at my perfect wife sitting there with my perfect daughter. There is an unwritten rule among parents with multiple kids: Whoever is sitting on your side is on your watch. So while the women in my life are enjoying this angelic scene of cooperation and intimacy, my son and I are on the verge of World War III.<br>Nothing is making him happy, nothing is stopping him from the beginning stages of an all&#x2013;out tantrum. Finally, his waffle arrives and I think the battle will be over soon. So, I start to cut the waffle up, but he doesn&#x2019;t want the waffle cut up. Maybe he wants to eat the whole thing with his hands in one bite, I don&#x2019;t know. I do know I&#x2019;m feeling closer and closer to my own emotional edge.<br><br>But I&#x2019;m the expert on human relationships, right? I&#x2019;m the one planning to write a book someday called <i>ScreamFree Parenting</i>. Was I going to allow a two&#x2013;year&#x2013;old to push my buttons? You bet I was. See, the fork got such a great response, my son began to wonder what might happen if he threw his waffle&#x2013;plate and all&#x2013;on the floor.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s what might happen: Daddy might lose his cool! And that&#x2019;s precisely what did happen.<br><br>I hastily apologized to the people with syrup splatter on their feet and then snatched Brandon out of his booster seat. Then I apologized to the man sitting in the booth behind us after Brandon&#x2019;s foot hit him in the back of his head. And then we stormed out of the restaurant. All eyes were fixed on us as my son kept screaming. And kicking. And hitting. I was seething as I pushed the door open with such force that it rattled the glass walls. The reverberating structure got everyone&#x2019;s attention. The entire restaurant saw me outside on the sidewalk, yelling at my son, using big words, asking rhetorical questions, puffing out my chest, pointing my finger, and intimidating a boy who couldn&#x2019;t have stood more than thirty&#x2013;six inches tall. What a big man I was!<br><br>Finally, somehow, the ugly scene ended. Brandon and I returned to our seats to complete our nice family breakfast. And there sat Jenny, my loving and faithful wife. I think she wanted to say something supportive and reassuring, but she just couldn&#x2019;t contain the smirk. I was a volcano looking for an excuse to erupt.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I barked.<br><br>&#x201c;Nice hat.&#x201d;<br><br>It was then that I realized the paper Waffle House hat still sat squarely on top of my head. The entire scene had taken place with a silly hat on top of a silly man who wanted nothing more than to be taken seriously.<br><b>Our Biggest Enemy as Parents</b><br><br>Truth be told, I didn&#x2019;t need the hat to make me look foolish. I had done that myself with my knee-jerk reactivity. In fact, that kind of emotional reaction is our worst enemy when it comes to having great relationships.<br><br>Let me say that again: <i>Emotional reactivity is our worst enemy when it comes to having great relationships.</i><br><br>If you don&#x2019;t get anything else from this book, get this: Our biggest struggle as parents is not with the television; it&#x2019;s not with bad influences; it&#x2019;s not even with drugs or alcohol. Our biggest struggle as parents is with our own emotional reactivity. That&#x2019;s why the greatest thing we can do for our kids is learn to focus on us, not them. Instead of anxiously trying to control our kids, let&#x2019;s concentrate on what we can control&#x2013;calming our own emotional, knee&#x2013;jerk reactions.<br><br>What&#x2019;s so damaging about being too reactive? Keep reading. The next couple of chapters will make it clear. For now, consider this: How can we have any influence on our children&#x2019;s decision&#x2013; making if we don&#x2019;t have an influence on our own? When we get reactive, we get regressive. That is, we shrink back to an immature level of functioning. Think of me at Waffle House. In an effort to get my two-year-old to stop acting so immaturely, I became just as immature.<br><br>How effective can that be? I&#x2019;ve come to realize that if I get loud and scary and intimidating, I may get compliance eventually, but at what price? I may have screamed my son into submission at Waffle House, but what type of relationship will I have with him if I continue to parent by reactive intimidation?<br><br>If we want to be influential, then we have to first bring ourselves under control. Only then can we choose our response. Only then can we choose how we want to behave, regardless of how our children choose to behave.<br><br>So if emotional reactivity is our biggest enemy, where does it come from? More important, what can we do about it? Most of us cannot think of a more terrifying emotion than feeling overwhelmed. We can feel scared, exhausted, worried, or angry, but nothing shuts us down, stops us in our tracks, and causes us to throw up our hands in futility like feeling overwhelmed. When we feel incapable of coping with, handling, or accomplishing all we have to do, we are overwhelmed. When it seems as if even if we weren&#x2019;t so tired and so frustrated we still couldn&#x2019;t keep all the plates spinning, that&#x2019;s about as scary as it gets. When we feel stretched beyond our limits, that's when we just want to quit.<br><br>And I can think of no more accurate description of how most of us parents feel far too much of the time. Far too often, we feel overwhelmed. We feel overstretched, overcommitted, underprepared, and underappreciated. That&#x2019;s a recipe for feeling overwhelmed. As a result, most of us feel a gnawing sense of inadequacy. We don't just feel like bad parents, we feel like failures.<br><b>Parents feel overstretched, overcommitted, underprepared, and underappreciated.</b><br>And unfortunately, our role as parents is the one area of life where we cannot afford to fail. If there is one area where we feel the pressure of absolute success, it is with our parenting. After all, we are bombarded with messages about the importance of time with our kids, involvement in our kids&#x2019; lives, and putting our family first among our priorities. Magazines are crammed with articles dispensing the newest parenting techniques and advice. Studies consistently show the ill effects of bad parenting. Churches preach the need to put families first. With all of this pressure comes just more fear and feelings of inadequacy.<br><br>And then there&#x2019;s the most intense pressure of all: How we do as parents will reverberate throughout history. We are raising the next generation, and they will either continue the success and progress of past generations or they will erase it all.<br><br>Anyone feeling overwhelmed?<br><br>Parenting is serious business. The stakes are unbelievably high. The cost of failure is unimaginable. I know you feel the intense weight of performing as a parent. You may wonder if you're the only one who sometimes feels inadequate, even inept. You may wonder: Is it supposed to be this hard? The answer is yes. And no. Yes, parenting is hard, and it&#x2019;s supposed to be. We&#x2019;ll get to that in the next few chapters. But no, we don&#x2019;t have to feel this much pressure. We don&#x2019;t have to feel overwhelmed.<br><b>The Most Damaging Lie About Parenting</b><br><br>The reason we feel so overwhelmed is because most of us are attempting to follow an impossible model. And it is fueled by a dangerous lie. Here is the most damaging lie about parenting: We are responsible <i>for</i> our children.<br><br>I know that to even question such a statement sounds ridiculous. &#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m responsible for my kids...who else would be?&#x201d; I can only ask you to bear with me and keep reading.<br><br>You see, most people would define parenting like this: &#x201c;It is our job as parents to get our children to think, feel, and, especially, behave the right way. It is our job to get our children to be good.&#x201d; Of course that&#x2019;s right, right?<br><br>Wrong.<br><br>Now, let me be clear. In my experience working with families, I&#x2019;ve seen the devastating effects of terrible parenting on now&#x2013;grown adults. Certainly we have a profound amount of influence on how our kids turn out. This book will illustrate the power we have to shape our children. In fact, I don&#x2019; t think we can overestimate this influence we have on future generations.<br><br>But what that really means is that we have a far greater responsibility <i>to</i> our children than we have <i>for</i> our children. Let me say that again, so it will sink in. We are much less responsible <i>for</i> our children than we&#x2019;ve ever been told. However, we have a far greater responsibility to our children than we've ever realized.<br><br>Most of us feel like we&#x2019;re responsible <i>for </i>our children. Sure, they&#x2019;re totally dependent on us right from the beginning. But let&#x2019;s think about that for a moment. If we are responsible <i>for</i> our children, then we have a really big problem. How long did it take you to realize that your child had a mind of her own? Early on, our children start to make their own choices. This is part of growing up. In truth, this <i>is</i> growing up. Even in infancy our kids start to embrace their natural ability to make decisions about what they will and will not do. They begin to choose how they feel, how they think, and how they behave.<br><br>I know this concept is simplistic, but it carries all the seeds of our frustration in raising kids. They simply make different choices than we want them to make! They choose to yell and scream in the grocery store. They choose not to do their homework. They choose to break curfew and disrespect our rules. They choose to throw their waffles on the floor in front of a restaurant full of people!<br>If you are responsible for your children, then you have to figure out how to program them to make the &#x201c;right&#x201d; choices. And you need to do it quickly. You have to learn the right techniques to get them to think, feel, and behave according to your definition of &#x201c;good.&#x201d;</p><h2>Island of the Dolls (World&#39;s Scariest Places)</h2><p><p><strong>USA Today and #1 Amazon bestselling author Jeremy Bates takes you to an infamous haunted island scattered with thousands of eerie dolls&#x2014;where more than just the toys&#x2019; glassy eyes are upon you.

The cards have the power to offer hope, reassurance, and reflective support to readers as they meander through the ups and downs of life. In fact, the Tarot has often been credited with illuminating solutions to major dilemmas, and even helping people avoid future misfortunes!<br><br>Of course, like anything in the Occult realm, the Tarot is surrounded by myths and misconceptions. Many people fear that they might discover bad news about their future fate and prefer to be &#x201c;kept in the dark.&#x201d; What they don&#x2019;t realize is that nothing revealed by the cards is set in stone&#x2014;the Tarot is a reflective tool rather than a predictive one. By seeking a reflection of your current situation, the past circumstances that have led up to it, and the possible actions you can take to change your course, you can actually break free of old patterns of worry, fear, and feeling &#x201c;stuck&#x201d; in life.<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve ever wanted a Tarot reading, or wondered what it takes to become a Tarot reader, <em>Tarot for Beginners</em> offers an informative first look into this long-trusted tradition. Best-selling author Lisa Chamberlain lets you in on the &#x201c;secrets&#x201d; of the art of Tarot. You&#x2019;ll learn what you need to know about the history of the cards and the components of a standard deck, as well as the general meanings of each card, instructions for two common types of readings, and guidelines for approaching the reading process. You&#x2019;ll also find tips for choosing your own deck and creating ideal conditions for powerful reading experiences.<br><br>Most guides to the Tarot are centered on a specific deck, such as the Waite-Smith, the Tarot of Marseille, or other decks ranging from the well-known to the rather obscure. While many of these books are very useful, their card interpretations tend to be restricted to the particular deck they focus on. <em>Tarot for Beginners</em> takes a different approach, offering a broader perspective on the Tarot as a whole, with basic card descriptions that can be applied to any deck, and used in tandem with any descriptions that accompany the deck you&#x2019;ve chosen to work with. So no matter which Tarot deck you use, the information in this guide is relevant, providing a solid starting point for a skill you can carry with you for a lifetime.<br><br><p><b>Foundations of Oracle Reading</b></p><br><br>There is a myth that you need to have &#x201c;psychic powers&#x201d; to read Tarot cards, but all you really need is determination and a willingness to hone your natural intuition. Reading the Tarot is a talent you can develop by following instructions, listening to your inner voice, and making educated leaps of thought. Seasoned Tarot readers would say that it&#x2019;s a natural habit&#x2014;something that, over time, becomes second nature.

" In the five short verses that followed, affectionately known as the Lord's prayer, Jesus gave Christians an inexhaustibly rich outline that enables us to transform the way we pray. . . and live. Kay Arthur writes "The Lord's prayer is a collection of index sentences, covering every element of prayer. Therefore, when you follow sentence by sentence, principle by principle, yo find yourself covering every possible aspect of prayer. Every requirement for prayer, every element of worship and praise, every perspective of intercession and petition is covered in the Lord's prayer. What a treasure our Lord gave us!" Lord, Teach Me to Prayer in 28 Days is sure to inspire a new confidence, hope, and joy in every believer who longs to enrich his or her prayer life and deepen his or her faith. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Trading Price Action Trends: Technical Analysis of Price Charts Bar by Bar for the Serious Trader</h2><p><b>A practical guide to profiting from institutional trading trends</b> <p>The key to being a successful trader is finding a system that works and sticking with it. Author Al Brooks has done just that. By simplifying his trading system and trading only 5-minute price charts he's found a way to capture profits regardless of market direction or economic climate. His first book, <i>Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar,</i> offered an informative examination of his system, but it didn't allow him to get into the real nuts and bolts of the approach. Now, with this new series of books, Brooks takes you step by step through the entire process.</p> <p>By breaking down his trading system into its simplest pieces: institutional piggybacking or trend trading (the topic of this particular book in the series), trading ranges, and transitions or reversals, this three book series offers access to Brooks' successful methodology. <i>Price Action Trends Bar by Bar</i> describes in detail what individual bars and combinations of bars can tell a trader about what institutions are doing. This is critical because the key to making money in trading is to piggyback institutions and you cannot do that unless you understand what the charts are telling you about their behavior. This book will allow you to see what type of trend is unfolding, so can use techniques that are specific to that type of trend to place the right trades.</p> <ul> <li>Discusses how to profit from institutional trading trends using technical analysis</li> <li>Outlines a detailed and original trading approach developed over the author's successful career as an independent trader</li> <li>Other books in the series include <i>Price Action Trading Ranges Bar by Bar</i> and <i>Price Action Reversals Bar by Bar</i></li> </ul> <p>If you're looking to make the most of your time in today's markets the trading insights found in <i>Price Action Trends Bar by Bar</i> will help you achieve this goal.</p></p><p><p>The key to being a successful trader is finding a system that works and sticking with it. Author Al Brooks, a technical analysis contributor to Futures magazine and an independent trader for twenty-five years, has done just that. Over the course of his career, he's found a way to capture consistent profits regardless of market direction or economic climate. And now, with his new three-book series&#x2014;which focuses on how to use price action to trade the markets&#x2014;Brooks takes you step by step through the entire process.</p> <p>In order to put his methodology in perspective, Brooks examines an essential array of price action basics and trends in this initial book; moves on to provide important insights on trading ranges, order management, and the mathematics of trading in the next book, <i>Trading Price Action TRADING RANGES</i>; and then discusses trend reversals, day trading, daily charts, options, and the best setups for all time frames in the third, and final, book of this series, <i>Trading Price Action REVERSALS</i>.</p> <p>Written with the serious trader in mind, <i>Trading Price Action TRENDS</i> skillfully addresses how understanding price action and effectively reading price charts, bar by bar, can help you follow unfolding patterns, which are all initiated by institutions, helping you to profitably piggyback onto their trades by setting up early entries with tight stops. Engaging and informative, this reliable guide:</p> <ul> <li>Discusses how to trade trends, trading ranges, breakouts, and reversals</li> <li>Examines the basic tools of trend lines and trend channels, which can be used to highlight the existence of trends and trading ranges</li> <li>Provides a detailed description of the significance of each type of candle, as well as the mathematics that traders need to know when placing trades</li> <li>And much more</li> </ul> <p>Throughout the book, Brooks focuses primarily on 5 minute candle charts&#x2014;all of which are created with TradeStation&#x2014;to illustrate basic principles, but also discusses daily and weekly charts. And since he trades more than just E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures, Brooks also details how price action can be used as the basis for trading stocks, forex, Treasury Note futures, and options. Foryour convenience, a companion website, which canbe found at wiley.com/go/tradingtrends, contains all of the charts provided in the book.</p> <p>Trading is a rewarding endeavor, but it's hard work and requires relentless discipline. To succeed, you have to stick to your rules and avoid emotion&#x2014;and you have to patiently wait to take only the best trades. <i>Trading Price Action TRENDS</i> is your first step in achieving this goal. With this guide, and the other two books in the series, you'll discover how to develop the patience and discipline to follow a sound system, and reap potentially huge financial rewards in the process.</p><p>Praise for <i>Trading Price Action Trends</i></p> <p>"Al Brooks has written a book every day trader should read. On all levels, he has kept trading simple, straightforward, and approachable.

Hers is a world where dragons and humans live and work side by side&#x2014;but below the surface, tensions and hostilities are on the rise. Seraphina guards her true self with all of her being, but when a member of the royal family is brutally murdered, she&#x2019;s suddenly thrust into the spotlight, drawn into the investigation alongside the dangerously perceptive Prince Lucian.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the two uncover a sinister plot to destroy the wavering peace of the kingdom, Seraphina&#x2019;s struggle to protect her secret becomes increasingly difficult . . . and its discovery could mean her very life.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Will appeal to both fans of Christopher Paolini&#x2019;s Eragon series and Robin McKinley&#x2019;s <i>The Hero and the Crown</i>."&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br><br> &#x201c;[A] lush, intricately plotted fantasy.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br> "Beautifully written. Some of the most interesting dragons I've read."&#x2014;Christopher Paolini, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Eragon</i><br> Meet Seraphina&#x2019;s sister, Tess, in Rachel Hartman&#x2019;s brand new fantasy adventure, <i>Tess of the Road</i>.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Teen Book of the Month, July 2012</strong>: In <i>Seraphina</i>, dragons and humans maintain an uneasy peace and for a woman who is both there is nowhere to turn for acceptance--not even within herself. Seraphina has spent her young life concealing the truth of her parentage and authentic nature, a task that proves ever more difficult when she is thrust into the spotlight of the royal court. Author Rachel Hartman&#x2019;s dragons take human form but shun the messiness of human emotion by remaining &#x201c;in ard&#x201d; (a highly rational state of mind), while their counterparts cling to a dangerous assumption of species superiority. As the anniversary of the treaty between the two sides approaches, court intrigue reaches a fever pitch and hard-won truths, betrayals, and intricacies of the heart are laid bare. <i>Seraphina</i> is a beautifully complex fantasy that delves into the most basic of desires&#x2014;to be loved, to belong, and to find peace in self-acceptance. --<i>Seira Wilson</i> <br><br> <p><b> Guest Review by Tamora Pierce</b></p> <p> <strong>Tamora Pierce is a best-selling author of fantasy books for teenagers. Her books, known for their teenaged girl warriors and wizards, have received critical acclaim and a strong fanbase. Her newest book, <em>Mastiff</em>, is the third book in The Legend of Beka Cooper series.</strong></p> <p> In Seraphina's world, coldly intellectual dragons can take on the shapes--and feelings--of human beings. Sometimes this results in a surprise. Seraphina's father married a beautiful musician, and discovered too late that she was a dragon. She died, leaving him with a daughter who confuses him and his new wife and children.</p> <p> Now the half-dragon Seraphina is the assistant to the cranky royal music master. She is in charge of Princess Glisselda's music lessons; she books performers for the 40-year celebration of the peace treaty between dragons and humans, and she rehearses the rowdy court musicians. She has to hide the scales on her arm and around her waist, and she can never let anyone find out that Orma, her music teacher, is actually a dragon.</p> <p> When she plays the solo for the funeral of the realm's murdered prince, Seraphina is suddenly raised into entirely new, visible levels of peril. People she always avoided are noticing her. She has to attend social functions, where she is caught up in court politics, between those who support the treaty and those who want to destroy it. She runs afoul of conspirators who want to start the war again--one of them may be her own grandfather. She even discovers that Prince Lucian, who is betrothed to Princess Glisselda, is not only very sharp-eyed but also very agreeable to be around. He appreciates her insights on intrigue at court and in the city and uses her as an unofficial investigator into the ongoing unrest.</p> <p> The plot thickens. A new religious order plots riots and revolution. Exiled knights return to report an unregulated dragon flying near where the old prince was murdered. The dragons are trying to send Orma for corrective surgery--they think he's gotten too human and they want to cut those parts out of his brain. Seraphina fears that if she tells the prince and the princess what she is, they'll hate her forever, but their work to preserve the treaty celebrations is bringing them closer together. And all of them are terrified that the dragons will decide that humans are not worth the trouble, and will destroy them at last.</p> <p>I loved this book even more the second time I read it than I did the first. The characters are interesting and engaging, and I love the new look at dragons. For all that she's half-dragon, Seraphina is a very believable human being, caught between different loyalties and just trying to keep everyone she loves alive. But don't take my word for it--read it yourself!</p>As a child, RACHEL HARTMAN played cello, lip-synched Mozart operas with her sisters, and fostered the deep love of music that inspired much of her award-winning debut novel, <i>Seraphina</i>.

He&#x2019;d been disoriented and sick to his stomach all night, catching sleep only in fitful, anxious, nightmare-fueled jags. His life had blown apart; his sanity was slipping away. His very surroundings--the foreign room, the alien bed--were unforgiving reminders of his terrifying new life. Fear sparked through his veins.<br><br> And his family. What had happened to his family? He wilted a little more every time he pictured them.<br><br> The very first traces of dawn--a gloomy, pale light--made the shuttered blinds of the window glow eerily. The Coffin next to the bed sat silent and dark, as foreboding as a casket dug from a grave. He could almost imagine it: the wood rotting and cracked, human remains spilling out. He didn&#x2019;t know how to look at the objects around him anymore. Real objects. He didn&#x2019;t even understand the word real. It was as if all his knowledge of the world had been yanked out from under his feet like a rug.<br><br> His brain couldn&#x2019;t grasp it all.<br><br> His . . . brain.<br><br> He almost burst out in a laugh, but it died in his chest.<br><br> Michael had only had an actual, physical brain for the last twelve hours. Not even a full day, he realized, and that pit in his stomach doubled in size.<br><br> Could it really all be true? Really?<br><br> Everything he knew was a result of artificial intelligence. Manufactured data and memories. Programmed technology. A created life. He could go on and on, each description somehow worse than the one before it. There was nothing real about him, and yet now here he was, transported through the VirtNet and the Mortality Doctrine program and turned into an actual human being. A living, breathing organism. A life, stolen. So that he could become something he didn&#x2019;t even understand. His view of the world had been shattered. Utterly.<br><br> Especially because he wasn&#x2019;t sure if he believed it. For all he knew, he could be in another program, another level of Lifeblood Deep. How could he ever again trust what was real and what was not? The uncertainty would drive him mad.<br><br> He rolled over and screamed into his pillow. His head--his stolen, unfamiliar head--ached from the thousands of thoughts that pounded through it, each one fighting for attention. Fighting to be processed and understood. And feeling pain here was no different from feeling it as a Tangent. Which only served to confuse him more. He couldn&#x2019;t accept that before last night he&#x2019;d just been a program, a long line of code. It didn&#x2019;t compute. That did make him laugh, and the pain in his head intensified and spread, slicing down his throat and filling his chest.<br><br> He yelled again, which didn&#x2019;t help, then forced himself to swing his legs off the bed and sit up. His feet touched the cool wooden floor, reminding him once again that he was now in a strange land. Lush carpet had blanketed the apartment he&#x2019;d always known, which seemed homier, warmer, safe. Not cold and hard. He wanted to talk to Helga, his nanny. He wanted his parents.<br><br> And those were the thoughts that almost did him in completely. He&#x2019;d been avoiding them, pressing them back into that pulsing swirl of thousands of other thoughts, but they weren&#x2019;t going anywhere. They stood out and demanded attention.<br><br> Helga. His parents.<br><br> If what Kaine had said was true, they were as synthetic as Michael&#x2019;s programmed fingernails had been. Even his memories. He would never know which ones had been programmed into his artificial intelligence and which ones he&#x2019;d actually experienced within the code of Lifeblood Deep. He didn&#x2019;t even know how long he&#x2019;d existed--his true age. He could be two months old, or three years, or a hundred.<br><br> He imagined his parents and Helga as fake, or gone, or dead, maybe never there in the first place. It just didn&#x2019;t make sense.<br><br> The ache that had crept its way into his chest filled his heart, and grief overtook him. He slumped back onto the bed and rolled over, pushing his face into the pillow. For the first time in his existence, Michael cried as an actual human being. But the tears felt no different than they ever had before.</p><h2>We All Go Traveling By (Barefoot Singalongs)</h2><p>All aboard!

The message of Santa turns out to be a brilliant way to explain the goodness gospel, and the true gospel is described with clarity. This book is a wonderful antidote to the tidal wave of Santa that kids absorb every Christmas through school, the media, and at shopping malls. I wish it had been available when my children were younger, to read together after all those school concerts where we always had to listen to "Santa Claus is coming to town", a song that Simon engages with in his book. This book will be greatly appreciated by parents who want their kids to grasp the difference between Santa s message and the gospel. I can imagine it becoming a family favourite that s read every year, as well as a widely used evangelistic and teaching resource for Sunday Schools, kids clubs, and Scripture classes. --Jean Williams, The Gospel Coalition Australia<br><br>This is an attractive, imaginative, and effective presentation of the gospel for children. It is quirky: Santa Claus converted by an elf is not a common idea! But it gets its message across clearly: both the nice and naughty are only saved by Christ s death on the cross.

This work is not a scan, but is a completely digitized and updated version of the original. Unlike, many other publishers of classic works, our publications are easy to read.

We can't promise perfection, but we're sure gonna try! Our goal is to bring you high quality Christian publications at rock bottom prices.</p> <p>That I, whose experience of teaching is extremely limited, should presume to discuss education is a matter, surely, that calls for no apology. It is a kind of behavior to which the present climate of opinion is wholly favorable. Bishops air their opinions about economics; biologists, about metaphysics; inorganic chemists, about theology; the most irrelevant people are appointed to highly technical ministries; and plain, blunt men write to the papers to say that Epstein and Picasso do not know how to draw. Up to a certain point, and provided that the criticisms are made with a reasonable modesty, these activities are commendable. Too much specialization is not a good thing. There is also one excellent reason why the veriest amateur may feel entitled to have an opinion about education. For if we are not all professional teachers, we have all, at some time or other, been taught. Even if we learnt nothing, perhaps in particular if we learnt nothing, our contribution to the discussion may have a potential value.</p></p><p></p><h2>Lost on Purpose: The Adventures of a 21st Century Mountain Man (Real-Life Adventures of the Texas Yeti)</h2><p>&#x201c;Lost on Purpose&#x201d; is the non-fiction adventure narrative of a former technology executive who reinvented himself as a 21st century mountain man.

Plans must be made. Who makes plans? Moms! Who simply must know the plans? Olivia, who is NOT above eavesdropping. But when she not-so-accidentally-but-kinda overhears her mom talking about her not-so-squeaky-clean-and-possibly-very-bad-behavior, Olivia&#x2019;s imagination runs wild...because it sounds like not only will there be no birthday, but Mom might just be sending her to military school instead. What a BAD birthday that would be!</p><p>Olivia would be <i>Eloise</i>, if Eloise were a pig. She is good at singing 40 very loud songs and is <i>very</i> good at wearing people out. And scaring the living daylights out of her little brother, Ian, particularly when he copies her every move. She is also quite skilled at reproducing Jackson Pollock's "Autumn Rhythm #30" on the walls at home. When her mother tucks her in at night and says, "You know, you really wear me out. But I love you anyway," Olivia precociously pronounces, "I love you anyway too." <p> <i>The New Yorker</i> artist Ian Falconer's endearing charcoal portraits of his porcine heroine are spotted with fire-engine red gouache in all the right places--perhaps a tribute to Hilary Knight's red, pink, white, and black celebrations of Olivia's human counterpart? When she dresses up, the bow on her ears, her red lipstick, and her high-heeled shoes are all red. (The only time her shades-of-gray body is pink is when she is sunburned and the area where her bathing suit was is white!) Falconer does a fine job of letting the spare text set up the jokes for the visual punch lines--a dryly humorous interplay that adults will appreciate as much as children.</p> <p> Preschoolers (and their parents) will see themselves in Olivia--a typical high-energy, over-the-top kid who likes the beach and Degas paintings, but hates naps. On the other hand, she combs her ears and is <i>unusually</i> gifted at sandcastle building. While we are certainly reminded of Eloise, Falconer's portrait is simpler in scope, less demented, and, as a result, less adult. Bottom line: precocious is fun, and we're tickled pink to have Olivia join the parade of, let's just say, <i>individualistic</i> youngsters.

But our bodies are wiser than we imagine. Moods are a finely tuned feedback system that allows us to be more empathic, intuitive, and aware of our own capabilities. If we deny our emotionality, we deny the breadth of our talents. <br> &nbsp;<br> Yet millions of American women are medicating away their emotions with psychiatric drugs whose effects are more far-reaching than most of us realize.&nbsp;And even if we don&#x2019;t pop a pill, women everywhere are numbing their emotions with food, alcohol, and a host of addictive behaviors that deny the wisdom of our bodies and keep us from addressing the real issues we face.<br> &nbsp;<br> Psychiatrist Julie Holland knows there is a better way. In <i>Moody Bitches</i>, she shares insider information about the drugs we&#x2019;re being offered and the direct link between food and mood, and she offers practical advice on sex, exercise, and sleep strategies, as well as some surprisingly effective natural therapies. In the tradition of&nbsp;<i>Our Bodies, Our Selves</i>, this groundbreaking guide will forge a much needed new path in women&#x2019;s health&#x2014;and offer women invaluable information on how to live better, and be more balanced, at every stage of life.</p></p><p><b>Dr. Julie Holland</b> has had a private psychiatric practice in Manhattan for twenty years. Her nationally bestselling memoir, <i>Weekends at Bellevue</i>, was based on her nine years running the psychiatric emergency room of America&#x2019;s oldest public hospital. Dr. Holland is an expert on drugs and the brain and appears regularly on the <i>Today</i> show and CNN. She lives in New York&#x2019;s Harlem Valley with her husband and two children.Women today are overworked and exhausted. We are anxious and frazzled, yet depressed and burned out. Our moods and libidos are at a rock-bottom low, our vital energies drained as we struggle to keep up with work, family, and hundreds of &#x201c;friends&#x201d; online. We blame ourselves for how bad we feel, thinking we should be able to handle it all. We dream of being perfect; we even try to make it look effortless, but we were never meant to be so static. We are designed by nature to be dynamic, cyclical, and, yes, moody. We are moody bitches, and that is a strength&#x2014;not a weakness.<br> &nbsp;<br> We evolved that way for good reasons; our hormonal oscillations are the basis for a sensitivity that allows us to be responsive to our environment. Our dynamism imparts flexibility and adaptability. Being fixed and rigid does not lend itself to survival. In nature, you adapt or you die. There is tremendous wisdom and peace available to us if we learn how our brains and bodies are supposed to work. Moodiness&#x2014;being sensitive, caring deeply, and occasionally being acutely dissatisfied&#x2014;is our natural source of power. <br> &nbsp;<br> Yet we have been told just the opposite.&nbsp; From a young age, we are taught that moodiness, and all that comes with it, is a bad thing. We learn to apologize for our tears, to suppress our anger, and to fear being called hysterical. Over the course of women&#x2019;s lives, the stresses and expectations of the modern world interfere with our health and hormones in ways big and small, and the result is the malaise so many women feel. There simply is a better way.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i> Moody Bitche</i>s opens the playbook on how we can take hold of our moods and, in so doing, take hold of our lives. By integrating timeless wisdom with today&#x2019;s science, we can master our moods. If we can understand our own bodies, our naturally cycling hormones, and how modern medicines derange our exquisitely calibrated machines, then we can make informed choices about how to live better.<br> &nbsp;<br> Women&#x2019;s hormones are constantly in flux. They ebb and flow over a month-long cycle and they wax and wane throughout decades of fertility, vacillating with particular volatility during adolescence and perimenopause, the spring and autumn of the reproductive years. Compare this to men&#x2019;s stable hormone levels throughout most of their lives. Our hormonal variations allow us to be empathic and intuitive&#x2014;to our environment, to our children&#x2019;s needs, and to our partners&#x2019; intentions. Women&#x2019;s emotionality is normal. It is a sign of health, not disease, and it is our single biggest asset. Yet one in four American women are choosing to medicate away their emotionality with psychiatric medications, and the effects are more far-reaching than most women realize.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether it&#x2019;s food, alcohol, drugs, cell phones, or shopping, we all rely on something in order to numb ourselves during difficult times. Whatever the chosen substance, it offers a welcome promise: that things will be different and better once it is consumed. But you can never get enough of something that almost works, and because our solutions are usually synthetic, not natural, we come up short. We are uncomfortable in our own skin, with our own desires; we are not at ease in our homes and offices, in our roles as parents or caretakers of our parents. Plowing forward, we think we can outrun the angst if we just stay &#x201c;insanely busy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In my psychiatric practice, my patients, like most women, are starved for information about the drugs they&#x2019;re taking and how they can change how they&#x2019;re feeling. Moody Bitches is an answer to both problems. I name names (which medicines I love, and the ones I avoid) and discuss the real side effects I&#x2019;ve observed&#x2014;weight gain, libido loss, becoming blas�&#x2014;and what you can do about them. I share straight talk about enhancing your sex life, the direct link between food and mood, sticking to exercise or sleep schedules, and perhaps the most important piece: tuning in to your body to realign with your natural, primal self.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I started my practice twenty years ago, women came to me confused by their symptoms and unsure of what to do. They complained of difficulty getting back to sleep or agitation or tearfulness, but they didn&#x2019;t quite know what was wrong. I helped them put a name to their symptoms and explained that there were medicines that could help. I needed to do more teaching about drug therapy back then, and a lot more hand-holding. I would set aside the last ten or fifteen minutes of the hour-long initial consultation in order to quell the fears of people who were wary of taking something that would alter their brain chemistry.<br> &nbsp;<br> These days, new patients come to me sure that they need medicine for their nerves or their moods, like most of the other women they know. They want me only to help them figure out which one. The confusion used to be: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t understand why I keep waking up at four in the morning&#x201d;; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so hard to get out of bed and I don&#x2019;t really care about anything&#x201d;; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m angry all the time, and I don&#x2019;t know why.&#x201d; But over the years, the conversation has morphed, so that now it usually begins with something like this: &#x201c;Can you tell me the difference between Wellbutrin and Effexor?&#x201d;; &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t figure out if I have ADD or OCD&#x201d;; &#x201c;Do you know that ad with the woman riding the horse on the beach?&#x201d;; &#x201c;Is that new butterfly sleeping pill better than Ambien?&#x201d; And the one I hear more than you can imagine from my established patients: &#x201c;Is there anything new I can try?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The drug companies started direct-to-consumer advertising in the 1980s. Soon after I started my private practice in the mid-1990s, it became less heavily regulated. Ads started springing up on television and in magazines, trumpeting the latest antidepressants and sleeping pills. I went along for the ride as America&#x2019;s use of all prescription psychiatric medications tripled during the nineties, as a direct result of this powerful marketing. By 2006 the antidepressant Zoloft had made more money than Tide detergent, and it became clear to me that something new was happening. Drug companies are spending billions of dollars to turn normal human experiences like fear or sadness into medical diseases. They aren&#x2019;t developing cures; they&#x2019;re creating customers. The problem is not our emotionality; the problem is that we are being persuaded to medicate it away.<br> &nbsp;<br> The latest news is particularly terrifying. Abilify, a medicine originally formulated to treat people with schizophrenia, expanded into the depression market and is now our nation&#x2019;s top-selling medication, and not just of psych meds. America&#x2019;s number one moneymaking medicine is an antipsychotic. As a psychiatrist, I must tell you, this is insane. There is an ancient Greek word, pharmakon, which held disparate meanings&#x2014; sacrament, medicine, and poison. It is a common saying in medicine that sometimes the treatment is worse than the disease. There are many medications (chemotherapy is a good example) that are helpful or curative at lower doses but dangerously toxic in higher amounts. It is also true that there are powerful medicines that are appropriately used for one diagnosis but are complete overkill for another. Prescribing antipsychotics to treat depression seems particularly out of balance, especially given the risks of irreversible side effects like diabetes or movement disorders inherent in this class of medicine.<br> &nbsp;<br> We represent 5 percent of the global population, yet we take 50 percent of the world&#x2019;s pills. (We also take 80 percent of the world&#x2019;s painkillers.) Meanwhile, the percentage of people labeled with psychiatric diagnoses is continually growing. Is it possible there really is an epidemic of mental illness and disability happening in our lifetime, or are physicians too quick to reach for their prescription pads instead of offering harder solutions to their patients&#x2019; complaints? Medical journals are full of only one kind of ad: pages of information on the newest drugs and exactly how to prescribe them. Four out of five prescriptions for antidepressants are not even written by psychiatrists but rather by general practitioners, and more often than not they&#x2019;re prescribed for patients without an actual diagnosis of depression. Particularly troubling: surveys of primary care doctors show they routinely overestimate what the antidepressants can do. They&#x2019;ve been hoodwinked by the ads, like the rest of America.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just as offering your toddler the choice between the red dress and the blue dress moves the conversation forward, beyond &#x201c;you need to wear a dress,&#x201d; the barrage of antidepressant advertising advances the question from Should I take an antidepressant? to Which one should I take? Don&#x2019;t let pharma-con change the way you manage your moodiness. I&#x2019;m here to tell you that there are healthier ways to treat depression, anxiety, and irritability that don&#x2019;t include pills.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is not solely the right cocktail of neurotransmitters that dictates mood; more than anything, it is how we live our lives. We can improve how we feel by changing behaviors around food, sex, exercise, addictions, and work/family balance. The problem with taking your happy pills and puttering along as before is that it&#x2019;s no better than sweeping dirt under the carpet. I want you to take that rug out back and beat the hell out of it.<br> &nbsp;<br> But this is not drudgery. It begins with awareness, with the natural process of reconnecting with yourself and your body. Understanding the meaning and utility of your moods is empowering. Reclaiming your authentic, natural self is liberating. It is wholesome and it is healing. Not just for you, but also for your partner, your family, and your community.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book begins with information about our complex inner workings, revealing the science behind why, as caregivers and nurturers, women have evolved to think and feel differently from men. I explain the wisdom of feeling deeply, and the dangers of cutting ourselves off from that depth. I look closely at why the twenty-eight-day cycle brings on tears and insatiable hunger (and what you can do about it), and how oral contraceptives and antidepressants can disrupt natural phases of desire and connection, potentially leading you to choose &#x201c;Mr. Wrong,&#x201d; or even to opt out of any mate choice entirely.<br> &nbsp;<br> The second section delves into relationships and family, with a particular focus on how women&#x2019;s moods mirror critical transition points in our lives. From menarche (the very first menstrual cycle) to mating, from motherhood to menopause, our ever-fluctuating hormones not only dictate but also respond to our behaviors. Testosterone may make you horny to go out and find a guy, but, more likely, seeing a hot new guy will make your testosterone levels rise. We tend to think of love and sex as distinct, but falling head over heels is a physical experience as powerful as any mind-altering drug, and orgasmic sex can trigger hormones that change how attached you are to your partner, complicating your casual hookups. The early stages of a relationship are difficult enough to navigate, but long-term commitment poses its own complications. Moody Bitches tells the truth about monogamy and desire, and why it is that your SSRI (antidepressants like Paxil or Zoloft) is likely not doing you any favors in the bedroom. I also explain the physical and emotional consequences of pregnancy and child rearing; becoming a mother changes not just your body but your brain. <br> &nbsp;<br> Change is the constant in women&#x2019;s lives, and never more so than in perimenopause, the transitional period before fertility ends that recalls the turmoil of pubescence. Moody Bitches unpacks the biology behind the &#x201c;cougar&#x201d; stereotype, describes the herbs and supplements that can combat hot flashes, and paves the way for the peace and freedom that await on the other side.<br> &nbsp;<br> The third section, the Moody Bitches Survival Guide, is an instruction manual for well-being at any age. We begin with a comprehensive introduction to inflammation, the basis of nearly every medical disease, including depression. Stress and inflammation are inextricably linked, and the key to combating both lies in a system you&#x2019;ve probably never heard of, the endocannabinoid system. When stress nearly knocks you overboard, your internal cannabinoid system helps to right the ship. Even if you&#x2019;ve never smoked a joint, your brain and body use cannabislike molecules to make you resilient to stress, similar to the way your endorphin system provides you with natural pain relief. These cannabinoids tamp down inflammation and reactivity in the body, maintaining metabolism, immune functioning, learning, and growing. The endocannabinoid&nbsp;system is mentioned throughout Moody Bitches, because it is involved in nearly everything we do, like eating, sleeping, exercising, having sex, giving birth, and nursing.<br> &nbsp;<br> The practices detailed in the survival guide are critical tools for establishing and preserving mental and physical health; they are designed to reduce stress and inflammation and augment the body&#x2019;s own spectacular capacity for producing pleasure. You&#x2019;ll learn about natural nutrition, so you can stop dieting and start eating for health, and normal sleep, so you can prioritize the hours your body needs. In fact, better sleep, nutrition, and regular cardio in the sunshine may just replace your SSRI. The survival guide also includes practical advice on sex that actually works and addresses the main obstacles women face in reaching orgasm. Getting into and enjoying your body, whether through sex, exercise, or that dreaded word mindfulness, will help you achieve the balance and harmony we&#x2019;re all clamoring for. Moody Bitches is a rallying cry for a new way of living. Our lives are out of sync with nature. I fear that the further away we get from what&#x2019;s natural for us, the sicker we&#x2019;re going to get. Our disconnection is our pathology. We need to get back in tune with our bodies and with the natural world around us. In our digital distraction we&#x2019;ve lost a basic truth: fresh air, sunlight, and movement make us feel better. Daily cycles of light and dark will do more for our sleep than any pill, being sedentary is our biggest health hazard, and we miss a lot when our relationships become virtual.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i> Moody Bitches </i>is grounded in research and informed by my experiences in working with my patients. Health begins with understanding, and my aim is to demystify women&#x2019;s inner lives to enable change. I&#x2019;m speaking as a psychiatrist, a wife, and a working mother of two children; the prescriptions I share here are what have worked for me, and for my patients.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our bodies are wiser than we ever imagined, and so much of what plagues them is interrelated. Overmedication has robbed us of our sense of control, and modern life has separated us from the restorative rhythms of nature. It is understandable to respond to the man-made madness of this world with tears and frustration; those feelings of distress are a pathway toward health and wholeness. We need to tune in to our discomfort, not turn it down. Being sensitive, being irritated, and being vocal about our needs and frustrations will improve our lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once we begin to listen to our bodies and align with our moodiness, ...</p><h2>The Black Farm</h2><p>After the loss of a child along with a slew of agonizing misfortunes, Nick and Jess decide to end their lives.

This Bible Study will lead you to resting and releasing your heavy burdens to the Lord. <p>This Bible Study includes a daily devotional written by Courtney Joseph, as she shares some of her personal struggles. She provides a daily Bible Reading plan, SOAK pages, a Daily Reflection Question and a Verse of the Day. You can find the corresponding videos out on the blog at WomenLivingWell.org</p><p></p><p>God wants you to talk with Him about your struggles, pains, and frustrations, and give Him all your cares in exchange for His peace. </p><p></p><p>Because we do not rest, we miss hearing God&#x2019;s voice. Psalm 23 comes to mind. &#x201c;The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d; </p><p></p><p>Are you experiencing the green pastures, the quiet waters, and the restoration of your soul that Psalm 23 speaks of, from resting with your Shepherd? </p><p></p><p>Remember how the crowds pressed in on Jesus everywhere He went? Everywhere He turned, there was a need unmet, and though there was so much to do . . . He withdrew to rest. Luke 5:16 says, &#x201c;But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.&#x201d; </p><p></p><p>If Jesus needed alone time with God, then certainly we do. Just think of the wisdom He wants to impart to you, the strength and the peace you may be missing out on. </p><p></p><p>Give yourself permission not to have your to-do list all checked off in order for you to rest and get alone with God. </p><p></p><p>Each weekday, Courtney provides for you a verse of the day, a short devotional, a reflection question and a daily scripture reading. </p><p></p><p>Also, on-line at WomenLivingWell.org you will find 4 videos (one per week) that correspond with the scripture we are studying each week.</p><p></p><p>Each week you will also find a practical challenge of something Courtney does in her home that helps her rest and live blessed. I hope you will take the challenges. They do make a difference!</p><p></p><p>I pray that your time spent in God&#x2019;s Word will lead you to rest for your soul and release of your burdens, so you can live a life of peace and freedom in Christ no matter what you are facing.

Rather than labeling or defining specific emotions and feelings, Visiting Feelings invites children to sense, explore, and befriend any feeling with acceptance and equanimity. Children can explore their emotions with their senses and gain an understanding of how feelings can lodge in the body, as conveyed by common expressions like &#x201c;a pit in the stomach&#x201d; or &#x201c;lump in the throat.&#x201d;<br><br> Children can cultivate this emotional intelligence and nurture a sense of mindfulness. In essence, mindfulness is tuning into yourself and paying attention to the present moment without judging or analyzing what you are thinking or feeling. Practicing mindfulness can enhance many aspects of a person&#x2019;s well-being, help develop insight and empathy, and enhance resiliency.<br><br> Taking the time to practice mindfulness as a family is a remarkable gift for parents to give to their children, and will help children as they navigate the teen years and adulthood.<br><br> Includes a "Note to Parents&#x201d; to provide more information about emotional awareness, and suggests ways to seamlessly incorporate mindfulness practices into your child and family's daily routines.</p></p><p>Beautifully descriptive prose and delightful illustrations cultivate a message of mindfulness and emotional awareness to help children fully experience the present moment. &#34;Visiting Feelings&#34; invites children to sense, explore, and befriend any feeling with acceptance and equanimity.

For example, adding a small router to your arsenal allows you to gracefully round edges on tables and shelves; buying a simple doweling jig opens up the world of joinery.<strong> In all, 14 fun projects will be presented, all built with just a few woodworking tools and off-the-shelf lumber.</strong></p></p><p><p>With a background in engineering, woodworking, and journalism, Asa Christiana hit the ground running when he arrived at <em>Fine Woodworking</em> magazine in 2000, rising to become chief editor, a job he held for 8 years.

If you're one of these people, this book was written especially for you.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Information is the key to success in any project or endeavor. Without the proper knowledge, you can make costly mistakes and waste your time as you trudge through the learning process.&nbsp; The projects in this book aim to <b>eliminate any guesswork</b> that you may have while working on your Boxster.&nbsp; My slogan has always been, "Let me make the mistakes and warn you about them, so you won't do the same."&nbsp; Believe me, I've made many mistakes and learned the hard way the best and worst way to <b>repair, restore, and modify</b> these cars.&nbsp; My lessons, as well as the lessons learned by the expert mechanics I've consulted with, are compiled here for you.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Who am I?&nbsp; I am the owner of one of the largest European online parts retailers, PelicanParts.com.&nbsp; I designed and built Pelican Parts especially for the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) mechanics who love to work on their own cars - people just like me.&nbsp; Our website has <b>hundreds of Porsche technical articles</b> that are the foundation for most of the projects in this book.&nbsp; If you like what you see in this book, then you will definitely enjoy more of the same at our website, PelicanParts.com.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The projects in this book are written in a format and style that should empower anyone to work on his or her car.&nbsp; One of the principal drawbacks to owning a Porsche is the high cost of maintaining it.&nbsp; You can literally <b>save thousands of dollars in mechanic's costs</b> simply by performing the work yourself. It is the goal of this book to get more people out working on their Boxsters - it's too much fun not to!&nbsp; Plus, when you personally complete a job on your Boxster, you get the added <b>satisfaction of having done it yourself</b>.&nbsp; Working on your own car can give you that emotional attachment to your Boxster that is common with Porsche owners.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; This book is divided into 11 sections, each focusing on a particular system of the Porsche Boxster.&nbsp; The "backyard" mechanic can perform almost all of the projects contained within these pages over a weekend or two.&nbsp; In an attempt to appeal to everyone, some of the projects are basic, and some are more advanced.&nbsp; Some of the projects are simply <b>overviews of systems found on the Boxster</b>.&nbsp; For example, Project 18, which covers superchargers and turbochargers, is simply meant to give you an inside look into what happens when you take your engine's performance to the next level. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most projects follow a distinct how-to format. <b>Step-by-step instructions</b> tell you how to perform the job, what tools to use, and what costly mistakes to avoid. The photos that accompany the projects tell a story of their own. I've<b> spread hints and tips throughout each project</b>, so make sure that you read all the text and captions in the photos before you start.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to this book, I've also created a <b>bonus website that contains additional information</b> and photos that I didn't have room to publish here in print.&nbsp; This bonus content is available for free at the main website for this book, 101projects.com.&nbsp; In addition, I've setup the site with a <b>discussion forum so that you can ask questions</b> and get feedback regarding any of the projects in the book.&nbsp; You can often find myself and many other Boxster experts there, ready to share knowledge and exchange ideas.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please don't be afraid to get this book dirty - take it with you underneath the car. Get it greasy. Compare the pictures in the book to your own car. Follow along step by step as you tear into each project. If this book gets dirty, then I will sleep well at night knowing that it's being put to good use.<br>While this book is a great guide for determining what upgrades and maintenance you need to perform on your Boxster, it's not meant to be the only book for your car.&nbsp; Limited by a fixed page count, I can't provide the detailed diagrams, torque settings, and factory procedures that are documented in the original factory workshop manuals.&nbsp; If you are planning to work on your own car, I recommend that you <b>invest as much as you can in books and information</b> that will help you along the way.&nbsp; Make sure that you review the Information Resources section in the next section of this book for my recommendations of the best places to find additional technical information for the Boxster.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; This book is not meant to be read from cover to cover, but is designed to be flipped through so that you can get an idea of what projects interest you for your Boxster.&nbsp; I've structured the projects so that you can simply open up the book and start working on your car.&nbsp; I do recommend, however, that you read the "<b>Tools of the Trade</b>" section in the first part of the book, and also Project 1, "<b>Jacking Up Your Car</b>," before you start working on any of the projects.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the features in this book that I have taken special care with is the index.&nbsp; I find it especially frustrating when a good book has a lousy index, where you can't find anything useful.&nbsp; For that reason, I've personally indexed the book according unique words found within each project, and also listed each index item under multiple names.&nbsp; This way, if there are different names for a part or procedure, it will still be <b>easy to locate it within the body of the text</b>.&nbsp; For example, brake discs are listed as both brake discs and brake rotors, as they are sometimes called.&nbsp; Please feel free to use the index as one of your primary guides to the book.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, remember that <b>safety should be your Number One concern</b>.

A must for every toddler and preschooler's library.<br>Little Golden Books have been loved by children for over 75 years. When they were first published in 1942, high-quality books for children hadn&#x2019;t been available at a price most people could afford. Little Golden Books changed that! Priced at just 25 cents and sold where people shopped every day, they caused an instant sensation and were soon purchased by the hundreds of thousands. Created by such talented writers as Margaret Wise Brown (author of <i>Goodnight Moon</i>) and Richard Scarry, Little Golden Books have helped millions of children develop a lifelong love of reading. Today, Little Golden Books feature beloved classics such as <i>The Poky Little Puppy</i> and <i>Scuffy the Tugboat</i>, hot licenses, and new original stories&#x2014;the classics of tomorrow, ready to be discovered between their sturdy cardboard covers and gold-foil spines.</p><p><b>Lilian Moore</b> (1909&#x2013;2004) was a poet and an editor who helped make children&#x2019;s books more affordable. She became the first editor of Scholastic&#x2019;s Arrow Book Club and Lucky Book Club after suggesting in 1957, while already working at Scholastic, that the company offer low-cost paperback editions of its books through the mail. She was also a prolific author of children&#x2019;s books, including <i>Old Rosie, The Horse Nobody Understood,</i> and the Little Raccoon series. &nbsp;<br><br><b>Garth Williams</b>&nbsp;(1912&#x2013;1996) was known for his realistic yet highly expressive animal characters. He brought to life some of the best-loved children&#x2019;s books of the twentieth century, including Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x2019;s Little House series and E. B. White&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Charlotte&#x2019;s Web</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Stuart Little</i>.

An inspirational educational leader, he had left his Heartprint not only on me, but thousands of other educators. It was my initial intent to reveal lessons he had taught me over the years about our profession. However, along the way, despite his own pain, he challenged me to expand the book to include the wisdom of many. When you read the Epilogue, know that those words reveal my reflections on the day of his final public message.&nbsp;As I began to write HEART!, I realized I wanted to speak through the vehicle of story, provide insight to the reader from thought leaders inside and outside of our profession, and ultimately allow the reader to tell their own educational story - to discover or re-discover their fundamental purpose for joining our great profession. And to do so, either in self-study or group (book club style) study. &nbsp;Eventually, each letter of the word HEART became an important part of the book and represented chapters of ideas reflecting both the struggle and the triumph of our daily work life as teachers and leaders. How can we live a professional life, school season after school season, that does not wear us down, or cause us to lose hope? A good friend of mine and loving critic, told me during the early and painful iterative stages of the manuscript process, "Above all else, make sure you take good care of the reader". In the end, I suppose you will have to decide if I succeeded!&nbsp;<p><strong>Timothy D.

The teacher says they can make maps of anyplace, so Lisa starts with her bedroom. She includes all the things that people will need to read the map, such as a scale and a key to the symbols she has used. </p><p>Her dog, Penny, helps with the map. This gives Lisa an idea: Why not map Penny's world? Making maps is so much fun that Lisa and Penny decide to visit some of the exotic places that they've drawn-but they won't forget to take a map along!</p><p>Now available in paperback, this engaging sequel to the bestselling M<i>easuring Penny</i> will delight teachers and students alike.</p></p><p><p><b>Loreen Leedy</b> is the author/illustrator of many children's books, including<i> It's Probably Penny</i> and the best-selling <i>Measuring Penny</i>. Born in Wilmington, Delaware, she majored in art in college but wasn't sure what kind of artist she wanted to be. She started out making jewelry in the shape of pigs, cats, dragons, and other animals, and then one day she started making book characters out of her animals. She is skilled at making concepts fun and accessible to children, and often speaks at conferences and in schools throughout the United States. She lives with her husband in central Florida.</p>Grade 1-3-Lisa and her dog from Measuring Penny (Holt, 1998) are back. Since the girl's class is learning about maps, she decides to draw one of her bedroom and then makes a few for her Boston terrier. These maps show where the pet has hidden her toys and treats, the best route for a neighboring animal to take to their house, biking and hiking trails (Penny rides in the bike basket), and a 3-D map of places where the pup likes to play. Lisa explains terms such as "key," "scale," and "symbol," and introduces tools such as pedometers and odometers. The concepts are clear, and the digital-painting and photo-collage illustrations are uncluttered and ably clarify the text. However, one illustration of Penny looking through a fish tank superimposed on a picture of Lisa's room might be confusing to some young readers. While the animal seems less a fully realized pet than a device for introducing maps, readers will enjoy traveling with this duo and learn much in the process. Libraries will welcome this as a complement to other books that introduce spatial concepts such as Gail Hartman's As the Crow Flies (Aladdin, 1993) and Joan Sweeney's Me on the Map (Crown, 1996).<br><i>Louise L.

With an extra-large trim size and special features including an embossed cover and four bonus spreads of never-before-seen materials, this handsome volume is a must-have for any Corduroy fan.</p><p>Have you ever dreamed of being locked in a department store at night? The endearing story of Corduroy paints a picture of the adventures that might unfold (for a teddy bear at least) in such a situation. When all the shoppers have gone home for the night, Corduroy climbs down from the shelf to look for his missing button. It's a brave new world! He accidentally gets on an elevator that he thinks <i>must</i> be a mountain and sees the furniture section that he thinks must be a palace. He tries to pull a button off the mattress, but he ends up falling off the bed and knocking over a lamp. The night watchman hears the crash, finds Corduroy, and puts him back on the shelf downstairs. The next morning, he finds that it's his lucky day! A little girl buys him with money she saved in her piggy bank and takes him home to her room. Corduroy decides that this <i>must</i> be home and that Lisa must be his friend.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>The Principal 50: Critical Leadership Questions for Inspiring Schoolwide Excellence</h2><p>"Why do I lead?"

A letter from the perpetrator draws Detective Hole further and further into the case, and together with his new partner, Katrine Bratt, he hunts the Snowman through twists and turns that become increasingly personal and may drive Hole to the brink of insanity. Brilliantly crafted, this credible and dark page-turner fully fleshes out the characters, especially Hole, a hardened detective with sharp instincts and real heart. What is the link between the victims? Is the Snowman a suspicious doctor, a notorious playboy, or one of Hole's peers on the force? The police keep thinking they've caught the criminal, but Hole's astute observations may steer him around the red herrings and right into the hands of the cold-as-ice killer. <em>--Miriam Landis</em>JO NESB� is a musician, songwriter, and economist, as well as a writer.

(a story about loss, healing, and friendship)</h2><p><b>A heartwarming story about loss, healing, and how to be a friend.</b><br><br><b>"[Offers] hope that the world can be beautiful place...an excellent purchase." --<i>School Library Journal</i></b><br><br>Elba has a big block. She's been dragging it around for a long time.<br><br>Norris dances everywhere he goes, even uphill. He is always surrounded by a happy cloud of butterflies.<br><br>Can Norris and his butterflies help ease Elba's sadness and convince her to join them on a trip to the ocean?<br><br>This tender exploration of loss illuminates how kindness, empathy, and friendship can lift our spirits and see us through many tomorrows. It will resonate with anyone who has experienced hardship or grief, from the death of a loved one or a pet, to a friend moving away, or the transition to a new home or family situation.</p><p>Charlotte Agell's inspiration for <i>Maybe Tomorrow?</i> came from her students. "They've taught me how important it is to address life's big issues, such as sadness and death. Through them, I witness the healing power of friendship." Charlotte was born in Norsj�, Sweden, and grew up in Sweden, Montreal, and Hong Kong. She lives in Brunswick, Maine and teaches in a<br>public school. You can learn more about her and her work at charlotteagell.com.<br>Ana Ram�rez Gonz�lez fell in love with <i>Maybe Tomorrow?</i> on the first read. "I felt Elba's burden and Norris's kindness in a way that was very personal. The text pulled at my heart because it resonated with something I was experiencing at that time. I felt like fate brought this project to me, and creating the pictures has been healing." Ana worked as a visual development artist on Pixar's Oscar-winning film <i>Coco</i> and illustrated the companion picture book <i>Coco: Miguel and the Grand Harmony</i>. She grew up in Guanajuato, Mexico, and lives in Oakland, California.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Elba, a pink hippopotamus, is weighed down by a heavy black block. Representing depression, anxiety, or sadness, the block is physically tethered to Elba, and greatly limits what she can do. Enter Norris, an alligator so cheerful that he dances everywhere he goes, "even uphill," surrounded by bevy of butterflies. Norris kindly but persistently encourages Elba to join him in various activities. Slowly, patiently, he cajoles Elba to try a few new things, always in a way that is comfortable for her. When it is raining, Norris joins Elba sitting on her block, and they quietly have tea. When Norris wants to go to the beach, he and the butterflies help Elba move the block. As they spend more time together, Elba eventually tells Norris about her friend, Little Bird, who is gone. Nonspecific about Little Bird's whereabouts, the painfulness of loss is a emotion that many children will recognize. Norris's concern for Elba does not erase her pain, but helps her manage it a little better. Watercolor, charcoal, graphite, and a combination of traditional and digital brushes are used to create appealing illustrations that acknowledge Elba's sadness while still offering hope that the world can be beautiful place. VERDICT This sensitive story will be valuable to adults helping children recognize and understand grief; an excellent purchase.&#x2014;Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond</p><h2>Teaching Self-Discipline: The Responsive Classroom Guide to Helping Students Dream, Behave, and Achieve in Elementary School</h2><p>Help students develop the intrinsic motivation to take care of themselves, each other, and their own learning!

She was formerly Managing Editor of a series of outdoors-themed books, and is the author of <i>Abundantly Wild: Collecting and Cooking Wild Edibles in the Upper Midwest</i>, as well as numerous other outdoors-related and regional cookbooks. Teresa has also written many magazine articles on wild foods and cooking, and has rekindled an early interest in photography.</p> <p><i>Wild Berries &amp; Fruits Field Guide of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan</i> combines her various skills and interests into a clear, concise, easy-to-use book that helps the user appreciate the diversity of the various wild berries and fruits that grow in this region. Teresa lives in Minneapolis with her husband, Bruce.</p><p><b>Cranberries</b><br> <i>Vaccinium spp.</i></p> <p><b>HABITAT:</b> Three species of wild cranberry are native to our region: small cranberry (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccus</i>), large cranberry (<i>V. macrocarpon</i>) and northern mountain cranberry (<i>V. vitis-idaea var. minus</i>). All are found in wet, acidic areas such as sphagnum bogs, swampy spots and fens.</p> <p><b>GROWTH:</b> A ground-hugging trailing plant; technically a subshrub, but vine-like in growth habit. Stems are slender and hairless. Cranberry plants often take root at the leaf nodes, forming dense mats.</p> <p><b>LEAVES:</b> Smooth, hairless, leathery evergreen leaves grow alternately on the slender stems. Leaves of small cranberry are less than 3&#x2044;8 inch long, lance-shaped with pointed tips, and white underneath; edges are rolled. Leaves of large cranberry are 1&#x2044;4 to 5&#x2044;8 inch long, narrowly oval with blunt tips, and pale underneath, but not as white as those of small cranberry; edges are flat or very slightly rolled. Leaves of northern mountain cranberry are 1&#x2044;4 to 3&#x2044;4 inch long, egg-shaped with rounded tips; undersides have tiny black resin dots (visible with a lens).</p> <p><b>FRUIT:</b> A tart, but delicious, red berry. Fruits of northern mountain cranberry and small cranberry grow on stalks at the tip of the stem; those of large cranberry grow along the stem rather than at the tip. Large cranberry has the largest fruits, averaging 1&#x2044;2 inch across; those of the other two species are 3&#x2044;8 inch or less. The fruits of large cranberry look out of proportion to the tiny leaves. There are no toxic look-alikes. </p><p><b>SEASON:</b> Cranberries ripen in late summer to early fall, and may persist on the evergreen plants through winter if not eaten by birds.</p> <p><b>COMPARE:</b> Several plants with edible berries have similar appearance. Creeping snowberry (pg. 258) has white berries; stems and leaves are hairy. Creeping wintergreen (pg. 110) has larger leaves, up to 2 inches. Both creeping snowberry and wintergreen smell spicy when crushed. Bearberry (pg. 108) has larger leaves, up to 1 inch, which are pointed at the base and broadly rounded at the tip.</p> <p><b>NOTES:</b> Cranberries are best when cooked, but can be eaten raw.</p></p><h2>The Little Scarecrow Boy</h2><p><p><strong>The celebrated author of <em>Goodnight Moon </em>and <em>The Runaway Bunny </em>joins forces with the Caldecott Medalist of <em>Smoky Night </em>to tell this tender story about loving and enduring family relationships.</strong></p><p>With words by the renowned<em> </em>Margaret Wise Brown<em> </em>and illustrations by David Diaz, this treasured picture book<em> </em>tells the tale of a little scarecrow boy and the lessons he learns from his scarecrow father about the world<strong>&#x2014;</strong>until he decides to test his knowledge and himself.</p><p>This tender and funny story celebrates the tradition of passing knowledge from one generation to the next, and the exuberance of reaching one&#x2019;s potential.

Travel to the age of the Renaissance and learn why Henry VIII is one of the most famous kings in English history.</b><br><br>Mainly remembered for his six marriages and his self-appointment as the "Supreme Head of the Church of England," Henry VIII was also attractive, educated, and athletic. When Henry Tudor ascended to the English thrown at the age of 17, his reign looked promising. But by the time of his death in 1547, King Henry VIII was characterized as an extremely egotistical, harsh, and insecure king. Though Henry VIII's legacy isn't free from scandal, his monarchy thrived due to the achievements of his daughter Queen Elizabeth I.</p><p>Ellen Labrecque is a former Senior Editor for <i>Sports Illustrated for Kids</i> and the author of over twenty nonfiction books for young readers, including biographies of Jim Thorpe and Magic Johnson and a number of Who Was? biographies.<b>Who Was Henry VIII?</b><br><br> &nbsp;<br> Henry VIII, the King of England, sat at the head of the long table. A trumpet blast alerted the hundreds of guests that dinner was about to begin. The tables were covered in fancy tablecloths and scattered with flowers and herbs. Before the meal began, a priest said the blessing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then, servers carried dish after dish from the kitchen. The plates were filled with roast pig, pigeon, peacock, and deer. <br> &nbsp;<br> On an average day, Henry and his guests could eat six oxen, forty sheep, twelve pigs, and 240 pigeons! Loaves of bread, dishes of butter, and leather jugs filled with beer were set on the table. A fountain spouted gallons of wine for the guests to enjoy.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the dinner was over, sweet tarts made with fruits from the royal garden were served. Henry ate the most and laughed the loudest of all. At the end of the banquet, he was given a gold cup filled with sweet wine and served wafer cookies stamped with the royal coat of arms. It was just a typical dinner for the king, but it was also quite a performance! <br> &nbsp;<br> Henry VIII was the all-powerful King of England from 1509 to 1547. He liked to do everything in a big way, especially eating, drinking, and throwing parties. He was very rich and spent a sum equal to $6 million a year just on parties and celebrations!<br> &nbsp;<br> But Henry could also be selfish and sometimes cruel. He was impulsive and lost his temper quickly. To anger the king in the 1500s was to risk your life. He had tens of thousands of his subjects put to death, including many brilliant men, simply because they disagreed with him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry VIII grew to believe that only God could tell him what to do. What this really meant was that he didn&#x2019;t listen to anyone but himself. Throughout his reign, Henry did anything he wished&#x2014;for the good and the bad&#x2014;of his country and people.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1: Young Henry</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry VIII was born Henry Tudor on June 28, 1491, in Greenwich Palace in London, England. His parents were King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York. <br> &nbsp;<br> The Tudors were a very religious Catholic family. The leaders of England had been Catholic for over a thousand years. They followed the teachings of the Pope in Rome, who is the head of the Catholic Church. Therefore, their subjects did, too. England was a Catholic country.<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry VII had become king in 1485, after thirty years of civil war known as the Wars of the Roses.<br> &nbsp;<br> Baby Henry was born a prince into a rich and royal world, but he was not born to be king. When Henry arrived, he had an older brother, Arthur, age four, and an older sister, Margaret, nearly two. Arthur, as the king&#x2019;s eldest son, was the heir to the throne. <br> &nbsp;<br> During Henry&#x2019;s early years, a staff of servants took care of him. This was common practice with royal people at this time. The servants did everything for him, including feeding, changing, and bathing him. Two official &#x201c;rockers&#x201d; rocked Henry to sleep every night.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Henry was four, his parents had another daughter, Mary. Henry spent his time in the royal nursery with his sisters and the servants who took care of his every need. Henry&#x2019;s older brother, Arthur, lived in his own private home, where he was being prepared to become the next king. As the only boy in the nursery, Henry was spoiled. <br> &nbsp;<br> Henry was a good-looking boy with red hair. He dressed in the fancy clothes of the time, including green velvet gowns lined with fur, high leather boots, and caps with ostrich feathers on top.<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry loved to play outside. He enjoyed tennis, horseback riding, archery, and hunting. He was a gifted athlete and could ride a horse at an early age. <br> &nbsp;<br> Because he was a rich prince and had the best tutors, Henry read a lot and he was very bright. He was taught by some of the smartest people in England! One tutor called Henry a &#x201c;brilliant pupil.&#x201d; He studied astronomy, science, and math. Henry also had a passion for religion and maps. Many fancy maps hung throughout the palace. And Henry never got tired of looking at them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry learned to speak many languages, including French, English, Latin, and Italian. He never minded studying, because he loved to read. He even filled up his books with handwritten notes in the margins.<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry also loved music. He had a good singing voice, and also played the lute&#x2014;an instrument like a small round-backed guitar. A group of musicians followed him wherever he went. They called him &#x201c;the harmonious prince.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Outside of Henry&#x2019;s royal world, life was hard for common people during this time. Servants did everything for Henry. But average people did everything themselves. They had to get their own water from wells, make their own clothes, and grow or catch their own food. Most children never even went to school to learn to read and write.<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry&#x2019;s life was exceptional. As a member of the royal family, he was a very special young boy.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Amelia Bedelia Chapter Book #12: Amelia Bedelia Digs In</h2><p><p>In the twelfth chapter book in the <em>New York Times&#x2013;</em>bestselling series, Amelia Bedelia heads to the beach for a summertime adventure.</p><p>With her cousin Jason and her best friend Alice by her side, she&#x2019;s ready to try surfing, explore Blackberry Island, and learn more about this pirate-obsessed beach town.

In his bestselling book <i>How to Measure Anything</i>, author Douglas W. Hubbard opened the business world's eyes to the critical need for better measurement. This book expands upon that premise and draws from <i>The Failure of Risk Management</i> to sound the alarm in the cybersecurity realm. Some of the field's premier risk management approaches actually <i>create</i> more risk than they mitigate, and questionable methods have been duplicated across industries and embedded in the products accepted as gospel. This book sheds light on these blatant risks, and provides alternate techniques that can help improve your current situation. You'll also learn which approaches are too risky to save, and are actually more damaging than a total lack of any security.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dangerous risk management methods abound; there is no industry more critically in need of solutions than cybersecurity. This book provides solutions where they exist, and advises when to change tracks entirely.</p> <ul> <li>Discover the shortcomings of cybersecurity's "best practices"</li> <li>Learn which risk management approaches actually create risk</li> <li>Improve your current practices with practical alterations</li> <li>Learn which methods are beyond saving, and worse than doing nothing</li> </ul> <p>Insightful and enlightening, this book will inspire a closer examination of your company's own risk management practices in the context of cybersecurity. The end goal is airtight data protection, so finding cracks in the vault is a positive thing&#x2014;as long as you get there before the bad guys do. <i>How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk</i> is your guide to more robust protection through better quantitative processes, approaches, and techniques.</p></p><p><p>What if your single biggest cybersecurity risk was the risk assessment method itself? Even if your approach to assessing this critical risk makes you feel more confident about your decisions, you may actually be making things worse. <i>How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk</i> presents real solutions by skillfully applying the quantitative language of risk analysis to information security.</p> <p>As with his previous <i>How to Measure Anything</i> books, measurement expert Douglas Hubbard simplifies the complexity of quantifying uncertainty and sheds light on matters with little data or seemingly intangible goals&#x2014;and here he taps cybersecurity influencer Richard Seiersen to dispel long-held beliefs about cybersecurity practices and provide authoritative guidance to solving problems by measuring risk. Together, they debunk popular risk scores and risk matrices and replace them with scientifically proven, yet practical, quantitative methods. </p><p>Immediately useful, this practical guide offers an easy path to better risk assessment by describing a very simple quantitative solution, building on it with more advanced methods, and providing detailed advice for choosing the one for your needs. Regardless of your current understanding of cybersecurity or statistics, everything inside is fully accessible and equips you with a potent collection of strategies and tools from today's top experts in cybersecurity and risk assessment. This complete resource gets you there start to finish by: </p><ul><li>Debunking the most common arguments against using quantitative methods in cybersecurity</li> <li>Modeling risk with a variety of simple and advanced techniques for enhancing the usefulness of data in times of great uncertainty using free, downloadable spreadsheets</li> <li>Detailing a dependable, organization-wide security metrics maturity model for continuous and measurable improvement</li></ul> <p>The thought process that goes into making informed decisions with sparse data points, using the described "Lens" method to reduce estimation errors, along with the many other techniques inside, will advance how you run cybersecurity as well as how you measurably improve other types of high-stakes decisions. <i>How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk</i> shows you nothing is immeasurable&#x2014;including your peace of mind.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk</i></b></p> <p>"I am excited to see a new method of risk management emerging from this book.

Composed entirely of volunteers from such ace fighting units as the Army Green Berets, Air Force Air Commandos, and Navy SEALs, SOG took on the most dangerous covert assignments, in the deadliest and most forbidding theaters of operation.<br><br>Major John L. Plaster, three-tour SOG veteran, shares the gripping exploits of these true American warriors. Here is a minute-by-minute, heartbeat-by-heartbeat account of SOG&#x2019;s stunning operations behind enemy lines&#x2014;penetrating heavily defended North Vietnamese military facilities, holding off mass enemy attacks, launching daring missions to rescue downed U.S. pilots. From sabotage to espionage to hand-to-hand combat, these are some of the most extraordinary true stories of honor and heroism in the history of the U.S. military.</p><p><b>Major John L. Plaster</b> is a national authority on sniping, firearms, and special operations, as well as the author of <i>Secret Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines With the Elite Warriors of SOG </i>and&nbsp;<i>SOG:&nbsp;The Secret Wars of America&#x2019;s Commandos in Vietnam</i>. He&nbsp;served three tours in the top-secret unconventional warfare group, Studies and Observations Group, in Vietnam. As a long-range reconnaissance leader, he led tiny intelligence-gathering teams behind enemy lines in Laos and Cambodia before leaving SOG in late 1971. He was decorated for heroism four times and retired from the U.S. Army as a major.A heavily anecdotal recounting of the covert, behind-enemy- lines operations undertaken by American special forces during the height of the war in Vietnam. Retired US Army Maj. Plaster served for three years as a Studies and Observation Group (SOG) commando in Southeast Asia. His book is a combat-heavy, laudatory accounting of the SOG's little- known role in the Vietnam War. From 1964 to 1971, SOG teams, made up of specially trained American volunteers (mainly Green Berets) and South Vietnamese hill tribesmen (known as Montagnards), took part in hundreds of combat, reconnaissance, and rescue missions in North and South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Plaster tells this story with a minimal amount of historical background, relying heavily on detailed recreation of individual SOG missions. Those action-filled accounts are based on the author's personal war-zone experiences and on interviews he conducted with dozens of former SOG operatives. Plaster writes about successful and failed missions, but accentuates the positive in assessing SOG's impact on the war. SOG ``logged a combat record unequaled in U.S. history,'' Plaster claims. He cites the number of medals the SOG units earned; the vast amount of North Vietnamese Army (NVA) arms and materiel the teams captured or destroyed; the valuable information they provided on NVA troop locations and movements; the courageous rescues of downed American pilots; and the large number of NVA soldiers killed by the teams and by American bombers using information provided by SOG. The teams' ratio of 150:1 enemy kills, Plaster says, ``was the highest documented kill ratio of any American unit in the war, exceeding the average by a factor of ten, and quite likely is the highest such ratio in U.S. history.'' Although short on documentation, this is the most comprehensive examination of widespread covert American actions during the Vietnam War.

Grant McClintock&#x2019;s first book struck a chord with fishermen, and fifteen years later he takes the reader back to these fabulous places&#x2014;from the storied Henry&#x2019;s Fork to the Yellowstone to the Thompson River in British Columbia. With extraordinary new photography and wisdom, McClintock revisits these home waters and discovers countless others as well. <i>Flywater</i> is a gallery of moments and places. From Idaho and Montana to Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, McClintock&#x2019;s rich photography of trout and steelhead waters surrounded by beautiful Western landscapes creates a compelling journey that the reader, whether fisherman or non-fisherman, will thoroughly enjoy. For the serious fly fisherman, this is an album of shared experiences. For the uninitiated, it is an artfully crafted guidebook to an exotic new world that really does exist on the streams and rivers of the American West.</p><p><b>Grant McClintock</b> divides his time between his native Oklahoma and Montana. Over the years he has fished, guided, and photographed many of the great trout, steelhead, and salmon rivers in the United States.

I've found that the main thing one needs in a relationship with God is hunger to know Him and be in His presence.</p><h2>A Weekend with Wendell</h2><p>Wendell was spending the weekend at Sophie&#39;s house. Playing house, Wendell was the mother, the father, and the children; Sophie was the dog. Playing bakery, Wendell was the baker; Sophie got to be the sweet roll. Wendell shone his flashlight in Sophie&#39;s eyes when she tried to sleep. But when he gave her a new hairdo with shaving cream, it was the last straw, and Sophie made up a game that left Wendell speechless for a time -- and won the day for friendship.</p><p><p>Kevin Henkes is an award-winning author and illustrator of many books for children of all ages.

Not only does he wreck Sophie's toys and dominate their games, but he also messes up the house and is generally a troublemaker.

Leading baker and instructor Richard Miscovich wants people to use their ovens to fulfill the goal of maximum heat utilization. Readers will find methods and techniques for cooking and baking in a wood-fired oven in the order of the appropriate temperature window. What comes first&#x2015;pizza, or pastry? Roasted vegetables or a braised pork loin? Clarified butter or beef jerky? In addition to an extensive section of delicious formulas for many types of bread, readers will find chapters on:<br> <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making pizza and other live-fire flatbreads; <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roasting fish and meats; <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grilling, steaming, braising, and frying; <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baking pastry and other recipes beyond breads; <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rendering animal fats and clarifying butter; <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food dehydration and infusing oils; <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And myriad other ways to use the oven's residual heat. <br> <br> Appendices include oven-design recommendations, a sample oven temperature log, Richard's baker's percentages, proper care of a sourdough starter, and more. . . . <br> <br> <em>From the Wood Fired Oven </em>is more than a cookbook; it reminds the reader of how a wood-fired oven (and fire, by extension) draws people together and bestows a sense of comfort and fellowship, very real human needs, especially in uncertain times. Indeed, cooking and baking from a wood-fired oven is a basic part of a resilient lifestyle, and a perfect example of valuable traditional skills being put to use in modern times.</p></p><p><p>Richard Miscovich began baking European hearth breads in 1996 after graduating in the first class taught at the San Francisco Baking Institute. During that same trip, he visited Alan Scott and was introduced to the Scott brick oven design--just as interest in artisan baking and wood-fired ovens dramatically increased. He immediately began construction of a wood-fired oven in coastal North Carolina, and opened an organic micro-bakery, One Acre Garden and Bakery, specializing in organic artisan hearth breads.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Currently, Richard is assistant professor at Johnson &amp; Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island. In addition to teaching culinary students, Richard is also a popular instructor for home bakers and brick oven hobbyists, and is a regular guest at venues around the country where he teaches artisan bread-baking techniques, wood-fired baking, and oven-building classes. In 2007, Richard organized and helped teach the first three-day wood-fired oven class track to be offered at The Bread Bakers Guild of America&#x2019;s biannual educational conference, Camp Bread. He served two terms on the Board of The Bread Bakers Guild of America.</p><br><br>Dan Wing, a biologist and physician by training, has written for publications as various as <i>Fine Homebuilding</i> and <i>The Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation</i>. He travels out from his home in Vermont in a gypsy wagon of his own construction, and naturally he built his own bread oven on wheels.<p><strong><em>ForeWord Reviews-</em></strong></p> <p>"Passionate thoughts combine with a spectacular range of ideas for using wood-fired ovens to make this guide a must-have for anyone curious about this well-loved cooking method.</p> <p>Although wood-fired ovens are best known for crispy pizza crusts and rustic breads, they can be utilized for a much wider array of tasks, from drying wood to roasting meats. Richard Miscovich&#x2019;s extensive guidebook on using these types of ovens celebrates the stunning breadth of tactics while also providing insights into history, homesteading, and masonry.</p> <p>Although there are several guides to building ovens and books that offer baking techniques, it&#x2019;s Miscovich&#x2019;s expertise at fusing these two worlds that proves especially helpful. In straightforward language, he breaks down factors like conduction, convection, radiant heat, thermal breaks, and other important aspects of wood-fired ovens.</p> <p>Guiding readers through the &#x201c;full heat cycle&#x201d; and its uses, he provides instructions on cooking everything from roasted vegetables to seared fish, and his in-depth sections on breads are particularly stunning. The step-by-step directions are easily understood, and there are so many variations to basic recipes that it would likely be challenging to tackle everything included. Accompanying photos capture the delicious results.</p> <p>Beyond the nuts-and-bolts approach to utilizing the ovens, Miscovich&#x2019;s guide returns often to the idea of sustainability. He writes about self-sufficiency, creating a reliable food supply, traditional skills, and community building. Cooking with fire isn&#x2019;t just a fun technique, he believes, but it&#x2019;s also a way to get back some of the wisdom and fellowship that&#x2019;s been lost: 'Wood-fired ovens fulfill resiliency&#x2019;s requirements: flexibility, diversity, and a backup system to ensure self-reliance instead of helplessness ... Generous sharing of information among bakers, millers, and oven builders increases our community&#x2019;s resilience.'"</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Even if you don&#x2019;t have a wood-fired oven, and you bake bread, get this book. The technical information about bread is approachable and correct and will bring your bread baking to the next level.&#x201d;<strong>--Solveig Tofte, co-owner, Sun Street Breads, Minneapolis</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Finally, a modern and comprehensive wood-fired oven management book! Richard addresses innovations in oven design and offers intelligent approaches to getting the most out of your wood-fired oven. Interweaving homespun anecdotes with solid bread baking and culinary instruction while offering clear explanations of oven design, this book answers the questions and concerns of bakers of all levels.&#x201d;<strong>--Melina Kelson, certified master baker, Bootleg Batard and Kendall College</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;So, you want a wood-fired oven to bake bread and have pizza parties? What should you build? How does it work? What else can it cook? As an oven-builder I hear these questions a lot, but the books I can recommend for cooking with fire say little about ovens, and the ones about bread and ovens don't take you very far with cooking. So I&#x2019;m glad to now be able to recommend Richard Miscovich&#x2019;s <em>From the Wood-Fired Oven. </em>He speaks with the authority of a professional baking instructor (and cook), an experienced mason, and a neighborhood baker; he also writes well, takes beautiful photos, and has a wealth of stories to tie it all together. He&#x2019;s worked with leading professionals in many fields, and teaches from extensive experience with bread, pizza, meats, vegetables, desserts, etc., as well as ovens, masonry, fire, heat, and more.&#x201d;<strong>--Kiko Denzer, author of <em>Build Your Own Earth Oven</em></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;When it comes to anything wood-fired, Richard Miscovich has set the new gold standard with his comprehensive book, <em>From the Wood-Fired Oven.</em> Both well written and inspiring, his book takes the reader on a journey that will delight and educate amateur and professional bakers alike. Richard is a master of this ancient craft, and his expert command of formula development, along with his knowledge of the classic and cutting-edge concepts in wood-fired oven construction, use, and maintenance, make this book unique and a must-have for any baker's library!&#x201d;<strong>--Ciril Hitz, author of <em>Baking Artisan Bread</em> and <em>Baking Artisan Pastries and Breads</em></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Richard has done so much more than just transfer his extensive knowledge about baking and wood-fired ovens onto paper in this book; he talks to the reader in a way that makes you feel that he is right in front of you, sharing his experiences, encouraging you to travel down a path that has brought him to where he is.&nbsp; His personal stories and experiences take this book beyond great, to one of a kind. I like that he doesn&#x2019;t assume the reader knows anything. You will learn about the bones of a wood-fired oven, including not just how to use it but how to make the most of it. He covers all the details and answers all the questions before you have to ask. It is a must-have addition to the collection of any food enthusiast, amateur or professional!&#x201d;<strong>--Jeff Yankellow, board chair, Bread Bakers Guild of America</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This is the book for which all wood-fired oven owners, hopeful owners, and serious bakers have been waiting. Richard Miscovich&#x2019;s descriptions and instructions are both practical and inspirationally poetic &#x2013; dare I say, soulful. He ignites the fire within, and compels us to want to know what he knows and to bake as well as he bakes. In this book, he shares it all.&#x201d;<strong>--Peter Reinhart, author of <em>The Bread Baker&#x2019;s Apprentice </em>and <em>Artisan Breads Everyday</em></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>-</strong></p> <p>"It&#x2019;s safe to say that most of us won&#x2019;t be baking in a wood-fired oven . . . at least, in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, for bread aficionados and others addicted to the tastes emanating from these kinds of ovens, there&#x2019;s no better substitute for the knowledge and expertise Miscovich imparts&#x2015;not to mention the 50-something recipes. He begins with the foundations: understanding ovens and fuel, operating guidelines, and all the processes that comprise bread-baking, from ingredients to proofing. Every chapter is filled with color photographs and, when necessary, step-by-step sequences. Where the author truly excels is in his very thorough explanation of recipes. They&#x2019;re woven into the text, using a narrative style. He freely gives advice, variations, and commentary on best and not-as-good versions, as well as caveats (e.g., what to expect from a bread starter when it&#x2019;s been transferred from another region). At times, personal stories appear, from his relationship with the late Alan Scott (a master brick-oven builder and coauthor of the seminal work on wood-fired ovens) to his bout with carpal tunnel syndrome.

I am in love with so many of the patterns and find them stylish and wearable." ~Girlsound<br><br> "If you're a beginner knitter who is ready to start reading and following your first real pattern, and you want designs that are wearable, choose this book." ~Caryn's Beach Reads<br><br> "...[T]he patterns look well written, with clear directions and charts and really, the items are gorgeous." ~Give Me a Book<br><br> "The authors evoke a warm coffeehouse oozing with friendship and wooly knitting projects. This would be a nice gift book for the knitters in your life." ~Cincy Coe, Sycamore Cove<br><br> "The instructions are clear and concise and the photos gorgeous--knitter of any level will enjoy this book and make amazing knits to wear in and out of the coffeehouse." ~Janet's Book Corner, Librarian<br><br> "<i>Coffeehouse Knits</i> is full of classic patterns that will be in style for many years to come... A selection of sweaters, mitts, mittens, hats, scarves, shawls and cowls in yarn that your fingers will itch to touch will have knitters of all experience levels eager to cast on." ~Michelle Ogden, Librarian<br> &nbsp;<br> "Love everything in this book.

Having a selection of not-so-difficult knits that look more impressive than a barista's latte art." ~Denise Murray, Librarian<br><br> "This book is stunning.

In 39 digestible, bite-sized chapters, Lee shares everything he has learned in his 40+ year career in the hospitality industry about creating an environment that keeps customers coming back for more. Here, Lee not only shows why the customer always rules, but also the Rules for serving customers so well they'll never want to do business with anyone but you. For example:<br><br>Rule #1: Customer Service Is Not a Department<br>Rule #3: Great Service Follows the Laws of Gravity <br>Rule #5: Ask Yourself "What Would Mom Do?"<br>Rule #19: Be a Copycat <br>Rule #25. Treat Every Customer like a Regular<br>Rule #39: Don&#x2019;t Try Too Hard<br><br>As simple as they are profound, these principles have been shown to work in companies as large as Disney and as small as a local coffee shop; from businesses selling cutting-edge technologies like computer tablets to those selling products as timeless as shoes and handbags; at corporations as long-standing as Ford Motors and those as nascent as a brand new start-up. And they have been proven indispensible at all levels of a company, from managers responsible for hiring and training employees, setting policies and procedures, and shaping the company culture to front line staff who deal directly with clients and customers<br><br>Chock-full of universal advice, applicable online and off,<i> The Customer Rules</i> is <i>the </i>essential handbook for service excellence everywhere.</p></p><p><p><b>Lee Cockerell</b> is the author of <i>Creating Magic: 10 Common Sense Leadership Strategies from a Life at Disney</i>, among others. He is the former Executive Vice President of Operations of Walt Disney World and has held executive positions at Hilton Hotels and Marriott.

It&#x2019;s not a website, or a phone number, or an option on a pre-recorded phone menu. Nor is it a task or a chore. It&#x2019;s a personal responsibility. And it&#x2019;s not the responsibility only of people called customer service reps. It&#x2019;s the responsibility of everyone in the organization, from the CEO to the newest and lowest-ranking frontline employee. In fact, everyone in the company should be thought of as a customer service rep, because in one way or another each of them has some impact on, and bears some responsibility for, the quality of the customer experience. Even if you never see or speak to a customer (or potential customer), you need to treat everyone with whom you interact--your vendors, your creditors, your suppliers, and so on--with sincerity and respect. Trust me, the great service you give them will ultimately trickle down to your customers.<br><br>Great service serves bottom-line business objectives. Sounds simple, but I constantly meet executives who don&#x2019;t understand that. They say things like &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the commodity business, and it&#x2019;s all about the product.&#x201d; I tell them that they&#x2019;d better have a great product, because the most extraordinary customer service in the world won&#x2019;t compensate for a bad one. But then I tell them that unless their product is the only one of its kind on the planet (and will always be the only one), good quality alone won&#x2019;t guarantee long-term profits. Time and again, customer service has been shown to be the best way to distinguish an outstanding company or organization from its competitors. Let&#x2019;s face it, no matter what business or industry you&#x2019;re in, there&#x2019;s probably someone--or many someones--who offers more or less the same product or service you do. But if you provide the same product plus personal service that feels authentic, you will have a leg up. No matter what business you&#x2019;re in, great service is a competitive advantage that costs you little or nothing but adds huge value for your customer. And it&#x2019;s one advantage you can&#x2019;t afford to pass up, because in today&#x2019;s highly competitive marketplace your customers will leave you in a heartbeat if your service doesn&#x2019;t measure up. Don&#x2019;t take my word for it; look at the research. In one study, customers were asked why they stopped doing business with a company. Forty-three percent named &#x201c;negative experience with a staff person&#x201d; as the main reason for taking their business elsewhere, and 30 percent said they moved on because they were made to feel they were not a valued customer.<br><br>My point is that most people expect quality products and services. It&#x2019;s the lowest common denominator. But if your company gives people the products or services they want and customer service that exceeds their expectations, you have an unbeatable combination, and one your competition can&#x2019;t easily imitate. Don&#x2019;t get confused about the difference between the services you sell and customer service. Services are what consumers come to you for and pay for. Customer service encompasses the entire experience, from the moment a person logs on to your website or walks through your front door until the moment they log off or walk out. It&#x2019;s what brings the human factor into a transaction. Some hardened number types scoff at the notion of the human factor. But as I&#x2019;ve learned over the course of decades working at some of the most profitable companies in the world, the emotional element is as important as--even more important than--the money that changes hands. That is why it should be delivered not just competently, but with ultimate respect, sincerity, and care.<br><br>Some managers and executives turn up their noses at the whole idea of service. They believe it&#x2019;s too &#x201c;soft&#x201d; for someone in their position of importance to think about, what with all the decisions they have to make and bottom lines they have to meet and the competitors breathing down their necks. Creating better products, building fresh ad campaigns, pioneering new technologies or markets--those tasks feel sexy to them. They get their juices flowing. To them, customer service is a department. It&#x2019;s something they can delegate to nice people who get along well with others. They couldn&#x2019;t be more misguided.<br><br>That is why everyone in a company should be considered part of the customer service department. Several years ago, when I was in charge of operations at Disney World, we changed the title of our frontline managers to &#x201c;guest service manager&#x201d; and required them to get out of the office and spend 80 percent of their shift in the operations, providing service support to their direct reports. Overnight, our guest satisfaction scores rose sharply. So whether you&#x2019;re the CEO, a midlevel manager, or the head of a small department, give your team members--and yourself!--responsibilities and titles that reflect their role in pleasing the customer.<br><br>Great service does not cost any more money than average or poor service. Yet the returns it delivers are spectacular. So invest in your company&#x2019;s commitment to service by making it part of every employee&#x2019;s job description and the guiding light of your entire operation.<br>Rule #2<br><br>You Win Customers One at a Time and Lose Them a Thousand at a Time<br><br>T here&#x2019;s an old saying in business: &#x201c;You win customers one at a time, and you lose them one at a time.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s outdated. In the age of social media, you can easily lose customers a thousand--even a -million--at a time. With a few keystrokes, one unhappy, frustrated, ticked-off customer can now tell her whole e-mail list, all her Facebook friends, and everyone who reads her blog or follows her on Twitter why they should not do business with you. She can voice her outrage into a smartphone and put it up on YouTube with clever graphics. With a little creativity, she can even go Michael Moore on you and shoot a mini-documentary, complete with music and special effects, and generate enough viral buzz to do serious damage to your business. One major airline found this out the hard way when they made soldiers returning from Afghanistan pay baggage fees for their fourth bag. The soldiers made a video of the incident and put it up on YouTube. Within a day, the airline received thousands of complaints and was forced to back down.<br><br>True, satisfied customers can also spread the word about what they like about a company. But will they? Maybe, if they&#x2019;re truly blown away by how great you are. But angry people are far more motivated to shout about their feelings, and furious expos�s get a lot more attention than glowing testimonials. Humans are wired to pay more attention to the negative than the positive--it&#x2019;s an evolutionary mechanism designed to keep us safe from danger. It&#x2019;s why drivers slow down to look at car wrecks, not at Good Samaritans helping someone fix a flat tire. It&#x2019;s why we remember warnings a lot better than we do recommendations. It&#x2019;s built into our DNA.<br><br>I know about that dynamic from my own experience. I see good service all the time, but I don&#x2019;t always go out of my way to write about it. However, when that same major airline once greeted a reasonable request of mine with a shocking and immediate &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I quickly posted a detailed description of my experience on my website blog.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s what happened. I had decided to combine some speaking engagements with a vacation for my wife and me, plus my son, his wife, and their three kids. The arrangement involved flying from Orlando to Boston, then on to Paris, and later from Paris to Johannesburg, South Africa, before returning to Orlando. I booked the flights through the airline, and let me tell you it was not cheap. About a month before the trip, I received an attractive invitation to give a speech in Boston. All it required was a slight change in my travel schedule. Not wanting to give up the opportunity or the fee, I told the rep that I wanted to cancel the Orlando to Boston segment of my itinerary and then board the Boston to Paris flight with my current ticket. That&#x2019;s all. I didn&#x2019;t ask for any money back for the unused flight. I didn&#x2019;t want to rearrange any of the other six tickets. I just wanted not to get on one of the flights. I was even willing to pay more, because fares had gone up since I&#x2019;d bought the tickets. Their answer: &#x201c;No.&#x201d; I spoke to several customer reps, and all I got was a chorus of &#x201c;No.&#x201d; Why? Because it&#x2019;s their policy. You can&#x2019;t change anything. If you&#x2019;re not on the Orlando to Boston flight, we will cancel the rest of your ticket, they told me. In other words, I had a choice: Either turn down the speaking opportunity or cancel my entire vacation. It is hard to imagine a dumber policy or a more self-defeating response to a request. I now fly with that airline only when there is no other way to get to my destination, even though I&#x2019;ve accumulated so many frequent-flier miles with them that I&#x2019;m often upgraded. But the upgrade is just one of their services, like online check-in. They don&#x2019;t seem to understand the difference between services like those and respectful, competent customer service with a human touch.<br><br>In my own small way, I am sending a message to that airline that shoddy service exacts a high cost. I tell that story in my speeches and workshops, often contrasting it with happy stories of flying other airlines that consistently do a great job of customer service.<br><br>The point is, every time a customer comes into contact with your business, whether in person, on the phone, or on your website, it&#x2019;s a moment of truth. Your reputation is about to get either better or worse. If you do something to tick off your customer at that moment of truth, you can bet hers won&#x2019;t be the only business you lose. Do something that adds value at that moment of truth, and he will look forward to coming back and will tell others about you. Do something that adds a lot of value, and that customer might be so stunned by your sincere, thoughtful, friendly, resourceful service that she&#x2019;ll go straight to her computer and tell the world. Satisfied customers are the best marketing staff you can possibly have. They, not your advertisements, are your true messengers. If that airline&#x2019;s service was half as good as its commercials, I would still be a happy customer.<br>Rule #3<br><br>Great Service Follows the Law of Gravity<br><br>It&#x2019;s a simple law of nature: The service ethos starts at the top. From there, it works its way down to every level of an organization. This is not a mere trickle-down effect; it flows quickly and surely, more like a waterfall than a faucet.<br><br>Whenever you see truly great service, whether it&#x2019;s from a local coffee shop or a global fast-food chain, a small financial services firm or a multinational bank, a rural clinic or a gigantic city hospital, it&#x2019;s a good bet that a senior person has made customer service an integral part of his or her strategy. Unless the people at the top of an organization, division, or department are dedicated to developing and maintaining superior service, it won&#x2019;t happen. They have to create the right agenda, allocate the necessary resources, establish the appropriate priorities, and set the proper tone. The best of those leaders also serve as role models, demonstrating the attributes of great service with every word, action, and communication--not just with customers, but with suppliers, colleagues, employees, and everyone else who has an impact on the way business is done.<br><br>In my experience, the leaders of companies that don&#x2019;t provide good service--the companies that consumers complain about the most--usually have the least people-oriented strategy. Their focus is on products, sales, marketing, and other business concerns. Those are all vital, of course, but in today&#x2019;s world they&#x2019;re not enough to drive long-term success. Managers have to recognize that sustained profits depend on their ability to generate consistent, ongoing, excellent service that keeps customers coming back and singing their praises.<br><br>During my career, I worked for three companies where sensational service generated spectacular business results: Hilton, Marriott, and Disney. In all those places, the service ethos flowed from the top. At Walt Disney World, for instance, when Judson Green, the head of parks and resorts, decided to radically change the corporate culture, he stood up in front of seven thousand managers in Orlando and told them exactly what he wanted to see happen. Then he went to Disneyland in California and on to France and Japan, laying out the same vision for the employees in each of those facilities. As someone who played a major role in designing and executing the plan, I can tell you that Judson&#x2019;s 100 percent commitment was contagious--as was mine and that of every other leader, at every level and at every stage of the rollout. Slowly but surely, everyone in the company learned that just having outstanding parks and the most recognized name in recreation and entertainment was not enough. Customers also need the emotional satisfaction of being treated like the most important people in the world. That add-on essentially became the Disney World brand.<br><br>No matter what your role or title, you can do a lot more to spread the ethos of service in your department, or within your own team, than you might think you can. Yes, the law of service gravity begins at the top, but the top is wherever you are. If you go to work every morning focused on customer service, you&#x2019;ll be surprised how powerful your example is and how quickly your mind--set will flow to those both under and around you. Remember, role modeling is by far the best teacher, and you are being watched every second of the day.<br><br>A few years ago, I read a book titled Leading Out Loud. It had a big impact on me. Its basic premise is that great leaders speak loudly and often about what they want their organizations to focus on and what employees are expected to do to achieve those goals. It&#x2019;s not unlike parenting. All parents know that they have to speak up over and over again to make sure their children understand and adopt the right values, behaviors, and social skills.<br><br>Whether it&#x2019;s raising children to grow up with integrity and respect for themselves and others or inspiring employees and colleagues to serve customers with excellence, you have to lead out loud. It will be a win-win for everyone concerned: you, your team, your customers, and everyone with a stake in your bottom line.</p><h2>My Life Among the Underdogs: A Memoir</h2><p><p><strong>From one of the most respected figures in the dog rescue community come the harrowing, funny, and inspiring stories of nine incredible dogs that shaped her life.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Tia Torres, beloved underdog advocate and star of Animal Planet's hit show <em>Pit Bulls &amp; Parolees,</em> chronicles her roller-coaster life in this heartwarming memoir featuring some of her best-loved dogs.

As she puts it, "Most of the stories in this book are about animals (and a few humans) that needed someone to believe in them and a purpose in order to show their true nobility." </p><p></p><p>Each dog Tia writes about here has overcome abuse, trauma, neglect, or just bad luck to become a stalwart, loving companion to Tia and her family.

After serving six years in the army, Torres worked for a Los Angeles city program to curb gang violence, serving as a liaison between the city and gang members. She also became an advocate for Pit Bulls, forming the Pit Bull Support Group, which offered free classes and assistance for Pit Bull owners. In 2006, she launched Underdawgz, a program that pairs parolees with rescue dogs.

Drafted against her will to become a &#x201c;Sparrow,&#x201d; a trained seductress in the service, Dominika is assigned to operate against Nathaniel Nash, a first-tour CIA officer who handles the CIA&#x2019;s most sensitive penetration of Russian intelligence. The two young intelligence officers, trained in their respective spy schools, collide in a charged atmosphere of tradecraft, deception, and, inevitably, a forbidden spiral of carnal attraction that threatens their careers and the security of America&#x2019;s most valuable mole in Moscow. Seeking revenge against her soulless masters, Dominika begins a fateful double life, recruited by the CIA to ferret out a high-level traitor in Washington; hunt down a Russian illegal buried deep in the US military and, against all odds, to return to Moscow as the new-generation penetration of Putin&#x2019;s intelligence service.

When we first meet Nate he is beginning the most important job of his fledgling career&#x2014;handling MARBLE, a high-ranking Russian intelligence officer who is giving information to the Americans, largely considered to be the CIA&#x2019;s most valuable asset&#x2014;while Dominika&#x2019;s first foray in the field is off to a more tenuous start. After being injured and thus forced to leave her beloved ballet, her uncle, a high ranking state intelligence official lures her in, eventually forcing her to attend &#x201c;Sparrow School&#x201d; to train as an espionage courtesan. After successfully finishing her training, Dominika is sent to Helsinki where the young Nate has taken up residence after a near disaster in Moscow. The Russians had discovered that he was gaining inside information, tipping them off to the existence of a high-level mole. Dominika is charged with the task of discovering the mole&#x2019;s identity by getting close to Nash&#x2014;a delectable honey trap for the brash American. What begins as a relatively simple assignment leads to a development of fatal double lives, dangerous spy games, and treacherous secrets. As the two face-off, tentatively making moves, Dominika begins to learn the true nature of those who control her, and suddenly Nate and the people he works for begin to look more and more attractive. Disappointed and humiliated by her handlers, and with nowhere to turn, Dominika is recruited by Nate (or is she?). Against the rules, the two fall in and out of bed in various cities, and come close to falling dangerously in love. They struggle mightily to trust each other, and to trust themselves.</p> <p>I read till 11 and woke up at 5 a.m. three days in a row to finish this book as fast as I possibly could. If it doesn't supplant <i>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</i> as the next mammoth read, and if it doesn't take its place alongside le Carre's <i>The Spy Who Came In From the Cold</i>, the love of literature and jaw-dropping thrills really is dead. When I finished the book the day was just dawning, as it always is in this novel, only in the novel the fated characters, filled with melancholy, romance, venom, and belly-aching humor (this book can be laugh out loud funny), are usually eating well and wondering when it'll be lights out for them. Jason Matthews has "reported" this book for 30 years, working it all out in the "real world," and one wonders who he is, mostly: the young, "naive" Nate Nash; the knock-out, petulant heroine Dominika, whom Quentin Tarantino and Doctor Zhivago both might've loved; or the Gus Grissom-like Gable, a CIA chief who dispenses life-lessons to the young Nate&#x2014;a muscled hen clucking and stirring a bubbling sauce over a stove. There is not a false note in the amazing ventriloquisms that are the conjurer's art we call literature. There are sentences as exciting to read as Eliot's "The Wasteland" (cf. the description of a moist, pale toadie scuttling along a hall; downright spooky, an image I cannot get rid of); or the majestic, floor-board creaking opening of Cormac McCarthy's <i>All The Pretty Horses</i>. The granular sweep of the authorial vision is a telescope still warm from Tolstoy's hands. There's a scene in here better by ten than Bogart looking down at Ingrid. I learned as much about the former Soviets and the new Russians, and our U.S. of A., as I have ever gleaned from the hardest working journalists writing today. Halfway through, I was afraid Vladimir Putin would find out I was reading <i>Red Sparrow</i> and have me arrested. With its ripped-from-the headlines appeal, real life spy craft details, and thrilling international action that takes us to Helsinki, Moscow, Athens, Rome, and Washington, D.C., I have to say that I have not read a more exciting, gripping novel in a long time. And the best part is this: the ending of this novel makes it clear that this isn&#x2019;t the last we&#x2019;ll be hearing from Jason Matthews.</p>Jason Matthews is a retired officer of the CIA&#x2019;s Operations Directorate.

Tina soon discovered that there was something seriously wrong with her fairytale. The marriage was filled with lies, deception, fraud and many tears. Tina was left in an utter state of confusion. This wasn&#39;t the man that she married...or was it? Tina first heard the term, Narcissistic Personality Disorder from her therapist in 2008 but quickly dismissed the notion that something could be wrong with her husband. It took several years for Tina to begin researching the disorder and suddenly, the past ten years of her life made complete sense. Tina soon discovered that there is only one thing more difficult than being married to a narcissist and that is divorcing a narcissist. In her book, Tina will explain how a smart, independent woman can fall prey to a narcissistic man. Tina discusses the red flag reflections that she chose to ignore while dating and during the marriage. Tina acted as her own attorney in an extremely high-conflict divorce and she will share the strategies that helped her to navigate through this battle while maintaining her sanity and sense of humor. Tina will help you to feel less alone in your journey and will assure you that there is light at the end of the tunnel no matter how dark things are right now. While Tina endured a tumultuous 6-year custody battle, she prevailed and today, her daughters have peace.</p><p>Tina Swithin has gained international attention for her blog titled, &#34;One Mom&#39;s Battle&#34; and for her role as an advocate for change in the Family Court System. Tina has survived a Category 5 Divorce Hurricane and has taken shelter in her blog and new book, &#34;Divorcing a Narcissist: One Mom&#39;s Battle.&#34; Tina resides in San Luis Obispo, California with her husband and two daughters.This is an important book with a compelling personal story by Tina Swithin. A must-read for anyone dealing with a narcissistic personality in a love relationship or in a divorce. As a family law attorney, I have observed this dynamic first-hand in divorce and custody cases. The narcissist spouse thrives on high conflict and will play out this dysfunction both inside and outside the legal system for years. These cases are pervasive, insidious and difficult for everyone the spouse, the children, the lawyers, the court staff, the judge, and even the mental health professionals who are brought in to help. Because of the nature of the personality disorder, the narcissist can appear perfectly normal and be hard to identify and diagnose. Tina Swithin is living testimony that it is possible to meet this dysfunction head-on and to take proactive legal and practical measures to protect the children and bring the truth to light. What I found most compelling about Tina s story is that she has not just survived these battles but has grown personally and spiritually from her struggle. Her book is as much about her emotional/mental health journey as it is about her legal saga. Through her writing, blog and public education campaign, Tina reaches out to individuals and professionals dealing with this disorder. Her story provides valuable information as well as inspiration and hope. --Alison L. Patton, Esq., Attorney and Mediator, Author of LemonadeDivorce.com, contributor to Huffington Post<br><br>It was an absolute honor for me to meet Tina Swithin. Every day, Tina is helping women get through a painful period of their life. Last night after my Broadway show, I was greeted at the stage door by a woman who gave me her divorce papers to autograph. I asked her if she was ok and a flood of tears quickly ensued. I understood. I suggested that she look up, One Mom s Battle and that she would find support and great advice to help her get through divorcing a narcissist. Thank you, Tina for creating a wonderful resource to share!!!! --Christie Brinkley, Actress and Supermodel<br><br>I have been a dedicated follower of Tina's blog and writings since early 2012. She shares her story and educates her readers with thoughtfulness, care, and intelligence. Tina's motivations are clearly the love of her precious children and the desire to help others navigate the challenging labyrinth of divorcing a narcissist. Her dedication inspires me to fight right along side of her and to encourage others to keep fighting, too. Her message is one of inspiration and hope that one day the justice system, mental health professionals, social workers, and other counselor-types will "get it" and redefine what "in the best interest of the children" should have meant all along. --Paula Carrasquillo, Yogi, Advocate, Contributing Writer to the Washington Times and Author of Escaping the Boy: My Life with a Sociopath</p><h2>A Beginner&#39;s Guide to the Traditional Latin Mass</h2><p>As the celebration of the classical Roman rite of Mass becomes increasingly common, this <i>Beginner&#x2019;s Guide to the Traditional Latin Mass</i> fills a real need.

What's an old woman to do when a skeleton pays her a birthday visit and beckons her to "come along"? Grandma Beetle, the heroine of this joyful book by the illustrator of <i>Harvesting Hope</i> [BKL Je 1 &amp; 15 03], stalls for time. "Just a minute," she says; there's something she needs to do. One chore leads to another, but the skeleton can't mask his enthusiasm as Grandma cooks, fills pinatas, and performs other tasks, each one linked to a number from 1 to 10, <i>uno</i> to <i>diez</i>. Eventually <i>nueve</i> grandchildren arrive for Grandma's birthday party, and guess who else is invited? Even if children don't grasp the implications of the skeleton's visit, they'll enjoy seeing him join the fun, and when he extends Grandma's lease on life, the relieved, loving embrace she gives her grandchildren will satisfy young ones at a gut level. Like the text, the rich, lively artwork draws strongly upon Mexican culture, with hints of Diego Rivera in Grandma's robust form, and the skeleton resembling the whimsical figurines often seen in Day of the Dead folk art. The splendid paintings and spirited storytelling--along with useful math and multicultural elements--augur a long, full life for this original folktale. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

From the possibilities presented by robotics to the &#34;civilizing potency of aluminum,&#34; from a &#34;self-acting engine&#34; to one of the first proposals to use solar power to run industrial civilization, and much more, this is a wide-ranging but illuminating look into the thoughts of an unsung hero of scientific philosophy.</p><p></p><h2>The Door in the Dragon&#39;s Throat (Volume 1)</h2><p>An American archeologist and his two children seek God&#39;s protection and guidance as they journey to the Near East, in search of a buried biblical treasure which local residents believe is cursed</p><p><p><strong>Frank E.

He and his wife, Barbara, live in the Pacific Northwest. www.frankperetti.com.</p>Grade 4 UpThe Door in the Dragon's Throat reads like a shortened version of Raiders of the Lost Ark, but the hero succeeds because, in his own words, "we serve a mighty God who is greater than any curse." Dr. Cooper and his children, Jay and Lila, have come to Nepur, in the Middle East, to enter the Dragon's Throat and unlock the door which legend says hides a treasure. Every imaginable disaster befalls theman explosion, a kidnapping, falling boulders, a viper attack, earthquakesbut in spite of numerous setbacks, the expedition succeeds. The writing is full of cliches and inconsistencies: a desert setting, a greedy king and his sly aide, a cavern in the earth where the forces of good and evil are fighting for control, an archaeologist who brandishes a gun as readily as he prays to God. The dialogue is stilted, and the vocabulary is too difficult for young readers who might overlook the poor characterization and heavily imposed theme of Christian belief. Far better fantasy adventures are Susan Cooper's The Dark Is Rising (Atheneum, 1973), Nancy Bond's Country of Broken Stone (Atheneum, 1980) and Robin McKinley's The Blue Sword (Greenwillow, 1982).

The chapters on animals are organized by land, sea, and air, and the book culminates with a section on springtime in the Arctic. The information about each creature includes the term for its young, size at birth and full grown, food, and enemies. The polar bear, arctic fox, arctic hare, muskox, arctic wolf, ringed seal, walrus, beluga whale, ptarmigan, snowy owl, gyrfalcon, caribou, and arctic tern are all introduced. The book does not include a table of contents, index, or glossary, which makes it difficult to use for reports, but beginning readers will enjoy reading it in its entirety or browsing to identify specific animals. The open format includes a few short sentences per page and softly colored illustrations of the animals in their natural habitat. An appropriate purchase for those looking for easy-to-read animal titles or books on the far North.<br><i>Helen Foster James, University of California at San Diego</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Dogma of Hell: Illustrated by Facts Taken From Profane and Sacred History</h2><p>The Dogma of Hell explores the basic Catholic doctrine on Hell, purposefully awakening in the reader a profound realization of its reality and eternity of horrors. Eminent French theologian Fr F X Schouppe, SJ, author of Purgatory Explained by the Lives and Legends of the Saints, has written here a similar but much smaller book.<br> <br> In short chapters, he has recounted numerous true stories, apparitions of the damned, and complete Catholic teaching on Hell. He clearly shows that for those who are not motivated to do good out of love of God, the fear of Hell is a legitimate and often salutary motive for avoiding sin.<br> <br> Although the subject matter is frightening, the ultimate purpose of this book is not to frighten souls, but to help them avoid damnation by reminding them of the pain and suffering in an eternity spent in the absence of God.</p><p>The eminent French theologian, Fr. F.X. Schouppe, S.J., (Purgatory Explained by the Lives and <p> Legends of the Saints), has written here a similar book on the subject of Hell. While the basic Catholic doctrines on Hell are reviewed, he mainly recounts numerous true stories that reinforce belief in Hell and the eternity of its horrors. The subject of Hell is frightening but the purpose of this work is not sensationalistic or to terrify, but rather to present lucidly to readers the reality of Hell and to instill in them a firm dread of the loss of Heaven. </p><p> We trust that reading this short volume will motivate many in their faith, bring others back to God and help people truly desire Salvation.</p>Father F.X. Schouppe, S.J. was an eminent theologian of the nineteenth century. He was the author of <i>Purgatory Explained by the Lives and Legends of the Saints</i> and <i>The Dogma of Hell</i>. His purpose with the latter work, though the subject itself is terrifying, was not to sensationalize or to horrify; but rather to instruct people on the reality of Hell and to excite them to a dread of losing Heaven. <i>The Dogma of Hell</i> was originally published in 1883 by P.V. Hickey, and <i>Purgatory Explained</i> was printed in the late 1800s with the Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur.</p><h2>Just Listen</h2><p><b>From the award-winning and New York Times bestselling author of <i>Once and for All</i><br><br>To find the truth you&#x2019;ve got to be willing to hear it.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>When she&#x2019;s modeling, Annabel is the picture of perfection.<br>&nbsp;<br>But her real life is far from perfect.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fortunately, she&#x2019;s got Owen.

My parents were both professors at the University of North Carolina: my mom is a classicist (which means she knows everything you could ever imagine about myths, Latin, and words) and my dad teaches Shakespeare (which means I&#x2019;d seen&nbsp; <i>As You Like It</i>&nbsp;about five times by the age of 18.) I have one brother, who is a musician and lives in California with his son and his wife, an artist who designed my personal website. (Thanks, Mariangeles!) <br> <br> "I&#x2019;ve been writing, in one way or another, for as long as I can remember. I was always a big reader, mostly because my parents were. I used to get frustrated with my mom because she bought me books for Christmas when what I really wanted were the gifts my friends got, things like sweaters and jewelry. But I did love to read. When I was eight or nine my parents gave me an old manual typewriter and a little desk in the corner of our den, and I&#x2019;d sit there and type up my stories. I was the kind of kid that people always sighed over and said, "She has such a wild imagination," which usually meant "I wish Sarah would try to stick to the truth." I have a tendency to embellish: I think it&#x2019;s just a weakness of fiction writers. Once you learn how to make a story better, it&#x2019;s hard not to do it all the time. <br> <br> "In high school, I was lucky enough to have a big group of girlfriends that have really inspired a lot of the stories in my books. I&#x2019;m still close with my friends from that time, so it&#x2019;s never very hard to put myself back into that place, that voice. Also it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to still be living in my hometown, where it&#x2019;s a given that I&#x2019;ll bump into people I had homeroom with, or guys I had big crushes on, while I&#x2019;m pumping gas or buying stamps. It makes it hard to leave high school behind entirely, which is a good or bad thing depending on what day you ask me. I attended college at UNC, where I studied creative writing and graduated with a degree in English. (Which means I can quote small parts of many Great Works. Comes in handy occasionally, like at cocktail parties.) I&#x2019;d been on the five-and-a-half year college plan, and when I graduated my parents were hoping I&#x2019;d settle down and get a Real Job so they could stop worrying about me. But instead of doing the whole resume/pantyhose thing, I decided to stick to my job waiting tables at the world famous Flying Burrito Restaurant and try to publish a novel. At the time, I had only one very bad book I&#x2019;d written my senior year of college and the beginnings of another one. Luckily, my family was supportive and I spent a few years living in a ramshackle little house where I wrote during the day and did the restaurant thing at night. <br> <br> "Three years after graduating, I sold my first book,&nbsp; <b>That Summer</b>, but it wasn&#x2019;t until a year after that that I got offered a teaching job and left waitressing for good. I still miss it sometimes, though. It was a great job for a writer. Endless conversations to eavesdrop, tons of material, and fast money without ever taking work home. Plus, free Mexican food, the best perk of all. Now, I&#x2019;ve published four books, all for young adults. I never really intended to be YA writer, but the second book I showed my agent she thought had a strong teenage voice, so she sent it off to an editor at Orchard Books, who bought it. Even though it was in a way accidental, I&#x2019;ve found that writing for teens suits me. I do short stories, and other novels, that are for an older audience, but again and again I am brought back to the stories of high school. Maybe it&#x2019;s because so much happened to me then that I&#x2019;m not finished yet telling everything. My senior quote was from Pink Floyd (okay, I was a bit of a burnout---I spent a lot of time in the parking lot, whatever, let&#x2019;s move on) and it pretty much summed up my future, although I didn&#x2019;t know it at the time. It was: "The time is gone, the song is over, thought I&#x2019;d something more to say." It turns out that I did. <br> <br> "The books I read when I was teenager, the good ones anyway, have stuck more in my mind than anything since. I still love books, but while I couldn&#x2019;t tell you complete plots of novels I read even six months ago, I do remember even the smallest descriptive details from Lois Lowry&#x2019;s&nbsp; <b>A Summer to Die</b>&nbsp;or Judy Blume&#x2019;s&nbsp; <b>Are You There God? It&#x2019;s Me, Margaret</b>. I think it was because back then books were still somewhat new to me, and when I found an author who seemed to say just what I was feeling, it really struck me and resonated. I hope that my books do that for the people who read them: I think it&#x2019;s the best thing to which any writer can aspire. Now, I teach writing at UNC-Chapel Hill, where I&#x2019;m lucky enough to see my students find their own voice, the way I did in the same program there not so long ago. Teaching is great for me, because I get to show people how writing can really change the way you see not only yourself but the world. I&#x2019;ve found in my own life that if my writing isn&#x2019;t going well, not much else will. It is the one constant, the key to everything else. <br> <br> "As far as my other life, my non-writing life, I live in the country with my husband, some lizards, and two dogs who are completely spoiled and rule me completely. I like to work in my garden---although I have not yet perfected the art of keeping everything alive----and, in my weaker moments, shop. I have a bit of an addiction to the Gap clearance rack, to be honest. I have this strange need to buy huge quantities of black pants. How many pairs of black pants does one person need? (Obviously for me, the answer is 11 and counting. But I digress.) What else can I tell you? I love Starbucks mochas but they make me way hyper. I subscribe to too many magazines. I make a mean bean salad. I could go on, but the truth is, my books are much more exciting than I am, and that&#x2019;s a good thing. It&#x2019;s always more fun to make stuff up anyway." <br><b>Sarah Dessen</b>&nbsp;is the author of thirteen novels, which include the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers&nbsp;<i>The Moon and More</i>,&nbsp;<i>What Happened to Goodbye</i>,&nbsp;<i>Along for the Ride</i>,&nbsp;<i>Lock and Key</i>,&nbsp;<i>Just Listen</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Truth About Forever</i>, and&nbsp;<i>This Lullaby</i>.

Edited by David Platt, Daniel L. Akin, and Tony Merida, this new commentary series, projected to be 48 volumes, takes a Christ-centered approach to expositing each book of the Bible. Rather than a verse-by-verse approach, the authors have crafted chapters that explain and apply key passages in their assigned Bible books.<br> &nbsp;<br> Readers will learn to see Christ in all aspects of Scripture, and they will be encouraged by the devotional nature of each exposition presented as sermons and divided into chapters that conclude with a &#x201c;Reflect &amp; Discuss&#x201d; section, making this series ideal for small group study, personal devotion, and even sermon preparation. It&#x2019;s not academic but rather presents an easy reading, practical and friendly commentary.<br> &nbsp;<br> The author of Exalting Jesus in John is Matt Carter and Josh Wredberg.<br><br> &#x201c;The balance of biblical accuracy, clear outlines, captivating illustrations, and life-changing applications make this commentary a must-have addition to the library of every pastor and everyone else who wants to understand and apply the Gospel of John.&#x201d;<br><b>Stephen Davey</b>, Th.M., D.D., senior pastor, Colonial Baptist Church, Cary, North Carolina; president, Shepherds Theological Seminary, Cary, North Carolina<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Matt and Joshua provide an excellent resource on John's Gospel. With a clear outline of content, a concise purpose for writing, and a faithful handling of the text as it points to Jesus, the authors give the reader a valuable resource for study and preaching. They herald a clear message to remind the reader, &#x2018;The gospel is the good news that you no longer have to wander about in the darkness and despair of sin, but you can enjoy the light of righteousness through Jesus Christ&#x2019; (p. 27). I commend this commentary as it will prove beneficial for many, for years to come.&#x201d;<br><b>Lane Harrison</b>, D.Min., lead pastor, LifePoint Church, Ozark, Missouri<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Gospel of John has no shortage of commentaries, raising the obvious question: what sets this one apart from all the others? The unique contribution of Matt Carter's work is rooted in his personal profile. Carter is both a highly successful church planter and long-tenured pastor who has built and led a large church through text-driven preaching. A church holding forth the truth in the heart of one of the most socially liberal cities in the country. A church that has multiplied itself many times over through planting new churches in their own city and in some of the most difficult countries on the planet. As a trustworthy, twenty-first-century pastor-theologian, Carter has not only produced a commentary, but a sermon and bible study starter for preachers and teachers seeking to accurately interpret and prophetically apply the Word of God to this radically changing culture.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><b>Nathan Lino, </b>senior pastor, Northeast Houston Baptist Church; president, Southern Baptists of Texas Convention<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This commentary on John is incredibly practical. Written from a pastor's heart, it provides both deep theological insight and practical application. Both ministers of the gospel and people in the pew need this work!&#x201d;<br><b>Jerry McCorkle</b>, executive director, SpreadTruth Ministries, Bloomington, Illinois<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;As a pastor for more than twenty-one years, I appreciate a commentary that stands on solid scholarship while at the same time fitting comfortably in the pulpit. Any pastor, teacher, or small group leader will be able to open this book and find a Christ-centered resource at their fingertips which will enhance their preaching or teaching ministry. In fact, any believer reading this Christ-centered exposition will find themselves learning more about the Lord Jesus Christ and His place in Scripture. The Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary series seeks to exalt Jesus. This volume succeeds in meeting that goal!&#x201d;<br><b>Eric Peacock</b>, D.Min., senior pastor, Westchester Baptist Church, High Point, North Carolina<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As the church navigates an age of profound confusion and doubt, the Gospel of John serves as an immoveable anchor. This commentary is an invaluable tool for believers in understanding and applying God&#x2019;s Word to our lives as we combat the litany of competing worldviews that surround us. This work remains faithful to the timeless truth of Scripture while challenging contemporary issues in a thoughtful manner. Believers will be well-served by using this book to supplement their efforts to delight in God&#x2019;s Word and to live by faith in Jesus, the Savior of the world.&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><b>Kevin Peck, </b>lead pastor, The Austin Stone Community Church, Austin, Texas<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;John said the purpose of his Gospel was &#x2018;<i>so that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name</i>&#x2019; (20:31). This volume is a literary GPS in helping us arrive at that place. Carter and Wredberg wed exegetical integrity with sermonic beauty, and they combine historical accuracy with contemporary relevance, all to show us Jesus. Pastors, teachers, and all who love the Bible and its Christ will be helped greatly by this work.&#x201d;<br><b>Jim Shaddix</b>, Ph.D., D.Min., W. A.

[Paperback] Fitzgerald, Bonnie</h2><p>With information gleaned from years of working for and studying with professional mosaic artists from around the world, this comprehensive guide provides essential information for creating beautiful mosaics that survive the elements and stand the test of time. Offering hundreds of valuable design and construction tips, diagrams, simple step-by-step directions, and photographs, the book explains how to create professional, stylish, and technically skilled mosaics. It contains clear instructions for the most commonly used mosaic methods, tips for avoiding potential pitfalls, and an easy-to-navigate technical guide with advice from master mosaicists on selecting the materials, tools, and techniques best suited to any mosaic project. Beginners, hobbyists, and professional artists alike will make the leap from mediocre to majestic mosaics with this understandable, uniquely organized reference.</p><p><b>Bonnie Fitzgerald</b> is the founder and owner of Maverick Mosaics Art School and Studio, an educational facility dedicated to nurturing expression through the art of mosaics.

She lives in Vienna, Virginia.<br>*Starred Review* Home in on the last two words of artist-maven Fitzgerald&#x2019;s title: Trade Secrets. That&#x2019;s exactly what you&#x2019;ll get when using this colorful, filled-to-the-brim reference for creating mosaics. The author spares no thought, no idea, no piece of advice, and it is all very well organized in five chapters: Essential Preparation, All about Tesserae, Researching and Planning Your Design, Working Methods, and Practical Applications. Icons helpfully define the type of counsel she offers: try it for substitutions; fix it for solutions (e.g., use olive oil on your hands after handling grout and other cement-based materials); and a jargon buster defines unusual words like adamento (i.e., the way it flows). Fitzgerald is also very pragmatic: charts show, in a glance, the pros and cons of adhesives, substrates, and tesserae, with a one to three ranking from easy to difficult, cheap to expensive. Ten projects (although usually crammed into two-page layouts) demonstrate different techniques; for instance, a flower shows how to use the direct-working project method, and a swimming fish shows tessellation. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>Touch and Feel: Tractor</h2><p><i>DK's beloved bestselling series gets a fresh new look!</i> <p>With a sparkling new look, these bestselling DK classics are sure to become classics for a whole new generation of young readers.

If I&#x2019;m not thinking about food, there&#x2019;s a good chance that I&#x2019;m out collecting it. I scrounge around in the mountains for huckleberries and I search riverbanks for wild asparagus, though mostly I hunt and fish. I suppose you could say that getting my own food is a hobby of mine, but I&#x2019;ve never looked at it that way. When I&#x2019;m packing an elk down off a mountain on my back, and it feels like my knees are going to crack open and my shoulders are going to strip away like banana peels beneath the weight, I certainly don&#x2019;t feel like I&#x2019;m pursuing a hobby.<br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, though; I love scavenging for my own food. I suppose it&#x2019;s important to clear that up right away&#x2014;that I think it&#x2019;s exciting to hunt and fish. People will happily pay good money for dead animals, so long as the animals are killed by proxy executioners and sold in grocery stores. But many of those same people are suspicious of folks who enjoy killing their own food in the wild. So let this serve as a warning about what kind of guy I am, and what kind of book this is.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, it&#x2019;s an oversimplification to say that I enjoy killing for the sake of killing. I enjoy killing in the same way that I enjoy cooking and eating and doing all the other things that it takes to stay alive. One time, I spent a couple of days shitting my brains out on a riverbank in northern Alaska because I ate some wild mushrooms that I could have sworn were safe. I actually enjoyed getting poisoned by those unpredictable fungi, because I was living out an experience that usually only happens to characters in fairy tales. Another time, my brother Matt and I were hunting elk and heading up a mountain trail at the same time that a five-hundred-pound grizzly and her two cubs were heading down it. The sow stood up on her back feet as easily as a human rising out of a chair. She held her arms out, paws down, like she was showing us an engagement ring. She was right there, within striking distance. I enjoyed the hell out of that, too. I guess I just like the whole package of wild food: eating, almost being killed, and, yes, killing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, I can&#x2019;t look at that statement of mine&#x2014;that I enjoy killing my own food&#x2014;without cringing. I&#x2019;m surprised that I came right out and said it. Even hunting and fishing magazines avoid saying that. Which is odd, because hunting and fishing are, fundamentally, ways of killing one&#x2019;s own food. You&#x2019;d think that a hunting and fishing magazine would be all about killing and eating. The thing is, publications like Outdoor Life, one of America&#x2019;s most venerable sporting magazines, try hard to distance themselves from anything that might be distasteful or insensitive to whoever thumbs through their magazines in the waiting rooms of the nation&#x2019;s dentists. Many outdoor writers discuss &#x201c;taking&#x201d; turkeys, &#x201c;collecting&#x201d; trophies, and &#x201c;harvesting&#x201d; pheasants, but they don&#x2019;t like to speak of killing anything.<br> &nbsp;<br> Through catch-and-release fishing&#x2014;a weird, paradoxical sort of game where you try to poke a hook through a fish&#x2019;s face without causing it harm&#x2014;fishermen have developed an even more thorough separation from their barbaric hunter-gatherer ancestors. Catch-and-release anglers &#x201c;play&#x201d; the fish and then toss it back. There&#x2019;s a reasonable chance that the fish will die from stress-induced increases in lactic acid within hours or days of its release, but by then the angler will be gone and he won&#x2019;t have to worry about what to do with a dead fish. Catch-and-release has endowed trout fishing with an aesthetic not unlike that of country-club golf, complete with vacation resorts, private lessons, boutique clothing shops, and cliquey social organizations. (The most notable distinction between catch-and-release and golf is that the plaything being knocked around in the former is a sentient being.) The stated goal of all this sanitization is to preserve hunting and fishing rights. Hunters and fishermen need a more modern, improved image, the argument goes; they need to be more like &#x201c;sportsmen.&#x201d; Ironically, though, most of the nonhunters I know believe that killing for sport is an abomination, and that hunting and fishing are justifiable only if the meat is being used thoroughly and responsibly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> I grew up in western Michigan, on an isthmus amid a cluster of four small lakes called North, West, Middle, and Twin. For some reason, the lakes are known collectively as Twin Lake. If you tell someone in Muskegon, the closest city, that you&#x2019;re from Twin Lake, he might ask, &#x201c;Oh yeah? Which one?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m from Middle Lake.<br> &nbsp;<br> In my parents&#x2019; living room, an aerial photograph of the four lakes hangs on the wall. The lakes look like the watery footprint of a three-toed dog, stamped into a canopy of oak and pine. The angle of the photograph is just right, the leaves just thick enough, to hide most of the houses. Twin Lake is a summer-cottage area transitioned into a blue-collar bedroom community, but if you had only the photograph to go by, you&#x2019;d think it was a wild, woodsy place.<br> &nbsp;<br> My brothers and I are just a couple of years apart in age. Matt&#x2019;s the oldest and Danny&#x2019;s in the middle. Growing up, the three of us were inseparable. We devoted much of our time and energy to scavenging food, though back then we would never have thought to call it that. We thought we were &#x201c;messing around.&#x201d; Food was just something that happened as a result of whatever else we were doing. One of my first memories is of walking along the shore in front of our house and finding a northern pike, over a couple of feet long, floating in the shallow water. It was still alive, with a speckled bass&#x2019;s head sticking out of its mouth. The speckled bass was still very alive too, but wedged supertight inside the pike&#x2019;s throat. Despite the hot sun and the obviously agonizing predicament, the two fish just floated in a sort of peaceful resignation, slowly opening and closing their gill covers. My brothers and I scooped up our catch in a net. It was like a two-for-one special. My dad fried them both for dinner.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another time, we watched a pregnant whitetail doe swim across the lake and run onto the beach, where she snapped her neck on a cyclone fence. The death of the doe and her fetuses seemed tragic to me, but I felt better when we had a party and cooked the animal in a charcoal roaster that my neighbor had welded out of an old oil tank. I couldn&#x2019;t stand to bury the doe&#x2019;s unborn fawns. They were both males, with belly-button-sized bumps where their horns would someday be. The fetuses were fully developed, except for the white tips of their hooves, which still seemed too soft for walking. I put them in the chest freezer we kept in our garage. Over the next several years, I&#x2019;d often pull the fawns out to admire them. Eventually the bodies were so caked in frost that I decided to give them a formal burial in the woods across the street from our house.<br> &nbsp;<br> My brothers and I were tight hunting partners as kids, taking our bicycles out to hunt squirrels, rabbits, muskrats, and ducks. We owned a small armada of dented-up canoes and rowboats that we used for fishing. We caught bluegills on their shallow-water spawning beds. The meat was white and flaky, and sometimes my dad would also cook the sacks of spawn cut from their bellies. We caught bullheads by diving down to their hiding spots at the bottom of the lake and jiggling lures in their faces. At night, we&#x2019;d hunt bullfrogs with spears.<br> &nbsp;<br> I can see now that my childhood was a little unusual. But compared to the stuff I liked to read when I was a kid, it seemed pedestrian to me. I used to like stories about the Ice Age Clovis hunters, who may have preserved their mastodon meat by &#x201c;anchoring&#x201d; it at the bottom of ponds with intestines packed full of gravel. And stories about the Comanche Indians, who would drink the warm and curdled mother&#x2019;s milk from the stomachs of freshly killed buffalo calves. And accounts of the Great Lakes Indians from where I grew up, who would tether sturgeon to the shore and remove hunks of flesh from the still-live fish. What I liked about those stories was the immediacy and physical intensity of the meals. I found that I could get hungry from reading about foods that would probably have made me sick if I&#x2019;d tried them. I used to dream of clawing my way back into the past, back to a time when food was so wild and real.<br> &nbsp;<br> A historian could make a good argument that human history is just a long story about the depersonalization of food production. Up until ten thousand years ago, every human being survived by hunting and gathering. Two thousand years ago, only half of the world&#x2019;s population survived by hunting and gathering. Over the last three to four hundred years, the number of hunter-gatherers has shrunk to just a couple of isolated pockets, located in the remotest corners of the globe.<br> &nbsp;<br> I watched with interest a few years ago when a major international news story erupted from the small town of Yakima, Washington. In December 2003, a Holstein dairy cow in Yakima County suffered injuries while birthing a calf. Because the cow was a &#x201c;downer,&#x201d; or nonambulatory, it was tested by the U.S. Department of Agriculture before slaughter. The cow was carrying the United States&#x2019; first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, and the discovery precipitated a temporary crash in beef markets and forced Japan and Mexico, the largest importers of U.S. beef, to halt shipments across their borders. A herd of 450 calves linked to the smitten cow were quickly destroyed. For weeks, the nightly news was dominated by images of destroyed, potentially diseased livestock. For the first time in their lives, many Americans found themselves using the phrase &#x201c;food safety.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>101 Things to Do With a Bundt� Pan (101 Cookbooks)</h2><p><p>101 Things To Do With A Bundt� Pan<i>offers a wide variety of not only cake and bread recipes, but sweet and savory sides, appetizers, brunch ideas, and dinner options.

Now he has to save them both&#x2014;from the inside out&#x2014;or die trying...<p><i><br></i></p></p><p>Television writer Lee Child's otherwise riveting first thriller, <i>Killing Floor</i>, was criticized by some reviewers because of an unconvincing coincidence at its center. Child addresses that problem in his second book--and thumbs his nose at those reviewers--by having his hero, ex-military policeman Jack Reacher, just happen to be walking by a Chicago dry cleaner when an attractive young FBI agent named Holly Johnson comes out carrying nine expensive outfits and a crutch to support her soccer-injured knee. As Holly stumbles, Reacher grabs her and her garments--which gets him kidnapped along with her by a trio of very determined badguys. "He had no problem with how he had gotten grabbed up in the first place," Child writes. "Just a freak of chance had put him alongside Holly Johnson at the exact time the snatch was going down. He was comfortable with that. He understood freak chances. Life was built out of freak chances, however much people would like to pretend otherwise." Lucky for Holly--whose father just happens to be an Army general and current head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, thus making her a tempting target for a bunch of Montana-based extremists--Reacher still has all the skills and strengths associated with his former occupation. And Child still knows how to write scenes of violent action better than virtually anyone else around. <i>--Dick Adler</i>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

T. Wright for Everyone Bible Study Guides)</h2><p>Paul must often have felt like a mother duck guiding her ducklings to safety. He had seen the enthusiasm of the Colossian Christians but knew they had no idea of the dangers they would face. Longing for them to continue growing in faith, Paul--now stuck in prison--wrote to his young flock, affirming them, warning them of hazards and pointing them to King Jesus, the supreme one who was with them and at work in them. These eight studies on Colossians and Philemon will similarly guide us toward maturity in King Jesus, who is still at work in his people today. This guide by Tom Wright can be used on its own or alongside his New Testament for Everyone commentary on Colossians and Philemon. It is designed to help you understand Scripture in fresh ways under the guidance of one of the world&#39;s leading New Testament scholars. Thoughtful questions, prayer suggestions, and useful background and cultural information all guide you or a group more deeply into God&#39;s Word. Discover how you can participate more fully in God&#39;s kingdom.</p><p><strong>N. T. (Tom) Wright</strong> is bishop of Durham and was formerly canon theologian of Westminster Abbey.

(Sports Illustrated Kids Then to WOW!)</h2><p><i>Baseball: Then to WOW!</i> shows readers how baseball has evolved from the early days of the 1920s to the game it is today. Using MLB action photographs, illustrations, stories, and trivia, the book is a journey through time both for baseball fans and those new to the game. Kids will learn how basic equipment has changed from fingerless gloves to specially tailored leather-bound mitts and how the evolution of game strategy has transformed the sport, players, and equipment. Players throughout history are stacked up against each other in every position so fans can dream up the perfect fantasy team with Babe Ruth playing alongside Hank Aaron and Reggie Jackson. A fun-filled section of the book explores everything fan culture-from the perfect ballpark frank to the importance of baseball cards and video games in popularizing the sport.</p><p>Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;Every aspect of our national pastime is covered in this attractive title. Using a time line format to tackle various decades, the editors provide details on players, umpires, dynasties, minor league teams, and even marketing. Readers learn about equipment, the evolution of many of the game's techniques and strategies, stadiums, and the best fielders, pitchers, and sluggers. Especially appealing are the lists of milestones for home runs, hits, and strikeouts. Though books such as Janet Wyman Coleman's Baseball for Everyone and Howard Bryant's Legends: The Best Players, Games, and Teams in Baseball contain more in-depth chapters, this title covers more ground. For instance, in addition to presenting a discussion of the first African Americans into the major leagues, this work offers information on Latin American players' influence on the sport. The chapter entitled "Fan-tastic" covers the fan experience and describes everything from baseball cards to ballpark foods. The text is complemented by well-placed photographs of teams and players as well as pencil drawings.

This edition includes the original chapter heading and ending illustrations.</p><p>Margaret (Mrs. Alfred) Gatty (1809&#x2013;4 October 1873) at Burnham on Crouch, Essex, was an English writer of children's literature. She was the daughter of the Rev. Alexander John Scott, D.D., a Royal Navy chaplain, who served under, and was the trusted friend of, Lord Nelson onboard the HMS Victory before and during the Battle of Trafalgar. She married the Rev. Alfred Gatty, D.D., Ecclesfield, Yorkshire in 1839 and moved into the vicarage of Church of St. Mary shortly after. She became a highly useful and popular writer of tales for young people. Among her books may be mentioned Parables from Nature, Worlds not Realised, Proverbs Illustrated, and Aunt Judy's Tales. She also conducted Aunt Judy's Magazine, a family publication written by various members of Margaret's large family. She became fascinated with marine biology, possibly on the advice of William Henry Harvey, who she had met in Hastings in 1848. Following this, she wrote a book on British seaweeds which dejargonised much of which had been written previously on the subject. She corresponded with many of the greatest marine biologists of her day including George Busk and Robert Brown. Margaret Gatty amassed a large collection of marine material, much of which gathered by her correspondents in far flung corners of the British Empire.

Gatty suffered from ill health for most of her life and is thought to have suffered from undiagnosed Multiple Sclerosis. Her frequent bouts of illness resulted in a close friendship with Dr. George Johnston, a Doctor noted for advocating pain relieving medication. He advised her on the use of Chloroform during child birth and Gatty became the first woman in Sheffield to use the drug during labour. Gatty was the mother of Juliana Horatia Ewing, also a writer of children's books, and Alfred Scott-Gatty, who served as Garter Principal King of Arms.</p><h2>Baltimore Omnibus Volume 1</h2><p><b>Lord Baltimore's story returns in a deluxe omnibus edition!</b> <p></p>After a devastating plague ends World War I, Europe is suddenly flooded with vampires.

Starting in 1982 as a bad inker for Marvel Comics, he swiftly evolved into a not-so-bad artist. By the late 1980s, he had begun to develop his own unique graphic style, with mainstream projects like <i>Cosmic Odyssey</i> and <i>Batman: Gotham by Gaslight</i>. In 1994, he published the first <i>Hellboy</i> series through Dark Horse. There are thirteen <i>Hellboy</i> graphic novels (with more on the way), several spin-off titles (<i>B.P.R.D</i>., <i>Lobster Johnson</i>, <i>Abe Sapien</i>, and <i>Sir Edward Grey: Witchfinder</i>), prose books, animated films, and two live-action films starring Ron Perlman. Along the way he worked on Francis Ford Coppola's film <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), was a production designer for Disney's <i>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</i> (2001), and was the visual consultant to director Guillermo del Toro on <i>Blade II</i> (2002), <i>Hellboy</i> (2004), and <i>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</i> (2008).

Follow her on Twitter @acaseforbooks.Matilda Pages pushed open the door of Pages &amp; Co. and breathed in deeply, taking in the familiar scent of just-blown-out candles, dark chocolate and, of course, books. For a second she forgot that she was splattered with muddy water and simply relished the week&#x2019;s holiday that stretched out in front of her like the view from the gate of a fairground. But the bubble of calm popped as the damp seeped through her tights, making her shiver, and she marched through the door connecting the bookshop to the narrow house she lived in with her grandparents. She let the door crash behind her, tossed her school bag on the table&#x2014;accidentally sending a pile of potatoes flying&#x2014;and flopped dramatically into a chair. <br><br>She paused, waiting for her grandmother to react, and when Grandma finally turned, Tilly flung her head theatrically on to her arms on the table. <br><br>&#x201c;Happy half-term, Tilly,&#x201d; Grandma said, looking around&nbsp;in confusion. &#x201c;What on earth is the matter? And why are you&nbsp;taking it out on the potatoes?&#x201d; <br><br>Tilly&#x2019;s cheeks, usually fair with a smattering of freckles,blushed a deep raspberry as she sheepishly started picking up the potatoes.<br><br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re soaking&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not still raining, is it?&#x201d; Grandma&nbsp;said, peering out of the kitchen window. She gave her granddaughter&#x2019;s&nbsp;head an affectionate rub as Tilly kneeled to rescue a&nbsp;stray potato that had rolled into the cat basket. Tilly sighed and&nbsp;leaned against Grandma&#x2019;s legs. <br><br>&#x201c;Grace went through a puddle on her bike and it splashed all over me.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Surely she didn&#x2019;t do it on purpose?&#x201d; Grandma asked gently. <br><br>Tilly harrumphed in disagreement. <br><br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you two as thick as thieves?&#x201d; Grandma said. <br><br>&#x201c;That was before, when we were just little. She has new&nbsp;friends now,&#x201d; Tilly said. &#x201c;She got on to the netball team, and&nbsp;only wants to be with those girls now. She sits with Ammara&nbsp;and Poppy every day.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have I met Ammara and Poppy?&#x201d; Grandma asked. <br><br>&#x201c;No, they went to St. Enid&#x2019;s, and they stick together all&nbsp;the time.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Well, why don&#x2019;t you invite some of them round during the&nbsp;holiday?&#x201d; Grandma suggested. &#x201c;Get to know each other?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;d come,&#x201d; Tilly said uncertainly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re&nbsp;always whispering and giggling about something when I try to&nbsp;talk to them.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;They might surprise you. You don&#x2019;t know if you don&#x2019;t ask,&#x201d; Grandma said. &#x201c;Be brave, Matilda. Be brave, be&#x2014;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Be brave, be curious, be kind,&#x201d; Tilly interrupted.&nbsp;&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s what we always used to tell your mum growing up,&#x201d; Grandma said. <br><br>&#x201c;I just think being brave comes more naturally to some people than others,&#x201d; Tilly said. <br><br>&#x201c;Often it&#x2019;s the things that don&#x2019;t come naturally to us that are the most important,&#x201d; Grandma said. &#x201c;Now, why don&#x2019;t you take off that wet uniform and have a shower? I&#x2019;ll make you a hot chocolate to celebrate the start of the holidays.&#x201d;<br>*** <br><br>Twenty minutes later Tilly was clean and dry, her dark brown curls considerably less damp, wearing her own clothes, carrying two mugs of hot chocolate covered in whipped cream, one for her and one for her grandad. She pushed the kitchen door open with her back and reversed into the bookshop. Pages &amp; Co. was Tilly&#x2019;s favorite place in the world. From outside, on the busy north London high street, it looked like an entirely normal bookshop, but once inside it didn&#x2019;t quite make sense how everything fitted inside its ordinary walls. <br><br>The shop was made up of five floors of corners and cubbyholes, sofas and squashy armchairs, and a labyrinth of bookshelves heading off in different directions. A spiral staircase danced up one wall, and painted wooden ladders stretched up into&nbsp;difficult-to-reach corners. Tall arched windows made it feel a&nbsp;little like a church when the light spilled in and dust&nbsp;motes danced in the air. When it was good weather&nbsp;the sun pooled on the floor and the bookshop&nbsp;cat&#x2014;named Alice for her curious nature&#x2014;could often be found dozing in the warmest spots.&nbsp;During the summer the big fireplace behind the till&nbsp;was filled to bursting with fresh flowers, but as it was October a&nbsp;fire was roaring there. <br><br>Tilly had never been very far outside London, but she felt&nbsp;like a seasoned traveler within the pages of books: she had raced&nbsp;across the rooftops of Paris, learned to ride a broomstick and seen the Northern Lights from the deck of a ship. She had&nbsp;explored wonderlands and secret gardens with girls curious and&nbsp;contrary. She found books that led to long debates with Grandad&nbsp; over crumpets dripping with butter, and discovered stories that&nbsp;she read again and again until they shone far more brightly than&nbsp;the endless tests at school. She found friendships that seemed&nbsp;free of the complicated social rules at school. Tilly sometimes&nbsp;felt like there had been a lesson where friendship had been&nbsp;explained, but she&#x2019;d been off poorly and had never quite been&nbsp;able to catch up.<br><br>Grandad was behind the till, sorting through books that&nbsp;customers had ordered, matching receipts to titles and stacking&nbsp;them neatly, ready for collection. Tilly deposited the second mug of hot chocolate on the till, managing to avoid spilling&nbsp;most of it. <br><br>&#x201c;Happy holidays, Tilly!&#x201d; he said, clinking mugs with her. <br><br>Grandad drank deeply and pretended, as he always did, that he&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t know he had whipped cream on his top lip. &#x201c;Got much&nbsp;homework?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I have to read a book I&#x2019;ve never read before,&#x201d; Tilly said,&nbsp;straight-faced. <br><br>&#x201c;Goodness, sweetheart,&#x201d; Grandad said with a grin. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d&nbsp;better crack on with that immediately, if you even have a hope&nbsp;of finishing in a week.&#x201d; <br><br>Tilly giggled as she stuck a finger in her whipped cream,&nbsp;thinking of the pile of five books she had stacked next to her bed&nbsp;for her holiday reading. <br><br>&#x201c;Ms. Webber did say that after the holidays we&#x2019;d be starting&nbsp;a project about our favorite characters from books, and that&nbsp;if we wanted to get a head start on that we should think about&nbsp;who ours were. Who would you pick?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What a question,&#x201d; Grandad said, licking the cream from&nbsp;his lip. &#x201c;I must admit my gut instinct is pulling me toward&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes, but I&#x2019;ll have to have a proper think and get&nbsp;back to you with my official answer. Now, other than your particularly&nbsp;arduous workload, what else do you have planned for&nbsp;the week? Is Grace coming over?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why you and Grandma keep asking me about&nbsp;Grace,&#x201d; Tilly said. <br><br>&#x201c;Do we?&#x201d; Grandad said, surprised. &#x201c;Well, I thought she was your best friend?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a best friend,&#x201d; Tilly said firmly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve realized there isn&#x2019;t anyone who&#x2019;s best-friend material at school.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And what exactly makes someone best-friend material?&#x201d; Grandad asked. <br><br>&#x201c;Someone who sticks by you; someone who never gets bored of talking to you. Someone who&#x2019;s adventurous, and clever, and brave, and funny . . .&#x201d; Tilly said, checking her criteria off on her fingers. &#x201c;Someone like Anne Shirley or Alice from Wonderland&#x2014;those are my favorite characters, incidentally.&#x201d; With very few exceptions Tilly found that she much preferred the company of characters in her books to most of the people she knew in real life. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure best friends are a one-size-fits-all sort of situation, Tilly,&#x201d; Grandad said carefully.<br><br> &#x201c;Sometimes a person who becomes a friend is the least likely person you&#x2019;d expect. Friends should bring out the best in you, not be the same as you. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re someone&#x2019;s perfect fit.&#x201d; <br><br>Tilly tried to imagine herself as the perfect fit for a potential best friend. But when she thought about herself too directly she felt sort of fuzzy round the edges, like a photograph that was blurred, and when she compared herself to the characters she met in books their ink and paper felt more real than her bones and skin. <br><br>&#x201c;And, for now, you&#x2019;ve always got me,&#x201d; Grandad continued.&nbsp;&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re in the market for an elderly best friend with whiskers and a bookshop.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; Tilly said, trying to erase all thoughts of hypothetical&nbsp;best friends from her mind. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need anyone who&nbsp;doesn&#x2019;t live in Pages &amp; Co.&#x201d;</p><h2>Halloween: The Official Movie Novelization</h2><p><b><b>The official novelization of the highly anticipated revamp of the classic horror film Halloween.</b></b><br><br>In 1978, Laurie Strode survived an encounter with Michael Myers, a masked figure who killed her friends and terrorized the town of Haddonfield, Illinois on Halloween night.

Meinecke has been writing about living the simply life in the wilderness for over 70 years with <i>Your Cabin in the Woods</i> and <i>Cabin Craft and Outdoor Living</i>. For the first time, these books are combined into a deluxe two-color vintage package.<br>In prose both practical and inspirational, Meinecke details how to turn your cabin dream into a reality, such as choosing land, using tools, and the basics of construction. He provides hand-drawn floor plans for a variety of cabins, from a simple two-room to a more complex long house; the best way to build fireplaces, both indoors and out; and instructions for basic furniture, lighting, and other touches that make a cabin feel like home. Throughout are Meinecke's thoughts on ways to enjoy your new-found space, from hearty fireplace recipes to the types of wood for a perfect fire and the beauty found in birdsong.<br>Instructional as it may be, the book's enduring appeal owes in large part to its warmly engaging tone and firm belief in the restorative power of nature and the satisfaction of hard work. He writes, "Take full enjoyment in the building. Take time out to rest. Most city folks seem always to rush things through. Why? Lay off until tomorrow. Take an afternoon nap. Stop the clock for the weekend. Get off to an early start in the cool of tomorrow morning. You may be crowded in your work in town, but this should be your rest cure, your recreating."<br></p><p>Conrad E.
